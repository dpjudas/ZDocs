'''A_SetRipMax''' (int ''max'')

Changes the calling actor's ripping minimum level to ''max''.

This is only beneficial to monsters. Any monster whose maximum ripping level is less than that of a projectile will prevent it from ripping into them, as if the monster had the DONTRIP flag for that particular projectile. Having 0 as a value means no maximum, as long as the projectile is a ripper and has something higher than the minimum, then it can rip through this monster.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This may still be bypassed if the monster has a specific ripper level. I.e. a monster has a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5 with a direct ripping level of 10, then ripper levels of 1 through 5 OR 10 can successfully rip them.
