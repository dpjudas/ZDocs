Gothick cannot really be considered to be two levels. Rather it is one level split into two parts. (for convenience in editing). The player starts in the first map, then goes to the second, then returns to the first again. The level is obviously set in a gothic/medieval setting. Below is a list of features:

-A variety of custom textures designed to enhance the ambience of the level
-Two maps, arranged in a seamless hub to feel like one level
-Several deadly monsters from the monster resource wad as well as some Hexen monsters to further enhance the dark, spooky, medieval atmosphere of the level.
-Two demonic weapons in addition to the original Doom weapons: the Hellstaff and the devastating Bloodscourge.
-Two terrifying bosses (Heresiarchs from Hexen) to do battle with at the end of the level.
-Well-designed architecture and lighting to provide that scary atmosphere.
-High-quality IT (related to the MOD format) music (provided by Cobra) to add that special creepy touch to the level
