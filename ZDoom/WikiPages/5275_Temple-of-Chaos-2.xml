== Description ==

Temple of Chaos 2 is the sequel to [[Skulltag]] map ''Temple of Chaos''. It won a [[Cacoward]] in 2005 at the same time as Spork's [[Ultimate Simplicity]] despite being a map the author allegedly put together in a few hours. Starting the player off with 1 health, the map pits him against a variety of different arena style battles featuring the Hectebus and Plasma Rifle Zombies, amongst other new and old enemies.

The main draw of the level however is its warped reality setting, where the player will find himself flitting between hell and techbase environments unexpectedly, sometimes having multiple different battles in what appears to be the same room. Featuring the usual Agent Spork mapping style and this fairly unique twist, this map comes highly recommended from many.
