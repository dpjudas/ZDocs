==Usage==
Causes the calling actor to inflict damage to the specified actor in the same way [[projectile]]s inflict damage to actors on impact (if defined, this also includes [[poison]]). This means that damage-related information the function needs to perform, such as {{Property|Damage|base damage}} and [[actor flags|flags]], are obtained from the calling actor.

While this function can be called by non-projectile actors, it is assumed that the calling actor is a projectile, and the function's usage should generally be restricted to that.

===Parameters===
*''target'': a pointer to the actor to damage. This must not be {{c|null}}.

==Examples==
This "nice" {{Class|PlasmaBall|plasma ball}} damages its shooter when it explodes.
 class NicePlasmaBall : {{Class|PlasmaBall}}
 {
     States
     {
     Death:
         PLSE A 0
         {
             // Does the shooter exist?
             // (for projectiles, their shooter is stored in their 'target' field).
             if (target)
             {
                 // Yes, it does. Then damage it.
                 [[DoMissileDamage]](target);
             }
         }
         Goto Super::Death;
     }
 }
