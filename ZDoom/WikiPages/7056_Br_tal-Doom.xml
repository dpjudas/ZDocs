== About ==
''Brütal Doom'' is a gameplay modification mod for [[GZDoom]] and [[Zandronum]], which emphasizes and exaggerate the fast pace and violence of a Doom game. Enemies are more aggressive and dangerous, and better able to navigate the level (beware, they may escape from situations where they are meant to stay stuck, such as the {{Class|cyberdemon}} in {{dw|E4M2:_Perfect_Hatred_(Doom)|E4M2}}). To compensate, weapons are more efficient, each one remaining useful even after more weapons are acquired; the most important change being the starting {{Class|pistol}} leaving place for a sniping rifle. With a {{Class|berserk}} pack, the fists allow to carry and throw explosive barrels, grab wounded enemies to use as meat shields, and perform "fatalities". The chainsaw can be used to cut up corpses to grab certain demonic weapons such as mancubus flamethrowers or revenant rocket launchers. 

''Brütal Doom'' v13 was the first recipient of the Cacowards' "Best Gameplay Mod" award.
