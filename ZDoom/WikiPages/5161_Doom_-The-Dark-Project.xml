== Description ==

NJTHIEF.wad is Enjay's merging of two of his favoured games - Thief: The Dark Project, and Doom2. With plethora of resources being used to create the right sort of atmosphere, you have to sneak (read slaughter) your way down the streets, through the sewers and through a mansion in order to get to the end.

This wad was later updated and converted to a Heretic map for use in [[GZDoom]] as [[Thief - The Trail of the Arch-Heretic]], and is really best for those of you who can't run GZDoom or Heretic or prefer a more classical approach.</text>
