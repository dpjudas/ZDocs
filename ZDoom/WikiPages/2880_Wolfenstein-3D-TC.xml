Wolfenstein 3D Total Conversion for Doom is a total conversion of Wolfenstein 3D to the Doom engine. The main objective of the project was to recreate Wolfenstein 3D in a more modern 2.5D engine, while still preserving the original gameplay, weapons, enemies, etc.

This TC relies heavily upon features found only in the latest version of ZDoom and its OpenGL derivative, GZDoom.

==Maps==
Maps were converted directly from the original game files with a modified version of {{forum|Simbey|root=memberlist|mode=viewprofile|u=565}}'s conversion program. Due to the limitations of polyobjects, secret doors don't work like the originals in the software renderer, but have been replaced by models in GZDoom.
