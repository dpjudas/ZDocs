bool '''SetActivatorToTarget''' (int ''tid'')

== Usage ==

This changes the activator of the script to the current target of the first actor found with the specified tid. Using a tid of 0 uses the current activator's target.

The search pattern works like this:
* If the tid being referenced is a living player, the new activator is first thing the player is aiming at.
* If the tid being referenced is a living monster, the new activator is the monster's target.
* If the tid being referenced is something that has died, the new activator is its killer.
* If the tid being referenced is a projectile, the new activator is the actor who fired it.
* If the actor has no target, the activator is the actor itself.
* If there are no actors with the given tid, the function returns 0 and leaves the current activator unchanged.

=== Parameters ===

* ''tid'': [[TID]] of the actor whose target will become the activator.

=== Return value ===

Returns true if the new activator exists. If there were no actors with the supplied tid, this function returns false and the activator is left unchanged.

== Examples ==
This example will destroy the first non-player actor that the player aims at.

 script 1 {{SType|Enter}}
 {
   while ([[PlayerNumber]]() &gt;= 0)
   {
     [[SetActivatorToTarget]](0);
     [[Delay]](1);
   }
   [[Thing_Destroy]](0, {{const|YES}});
 }
