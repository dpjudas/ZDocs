== Description ==

Created for Hexen as a five-map hub, '''Wolfen''' brings together a storyline, new creatures and a storyline to create one of the most popular HeXen hubs ever made. Aside from the new enemies and boss, there is also "Aeon mana" which is a constantly regenerating form of mana used to power your special abilities (this requires a button to be configured in order to use it).

The players goal is to battle through the hub in order to wipe out the wolfen army, solving puzzles in true Hexen fashion in order to unlock the boss fight in the central map. Locations range from the sanctuary to a decimated village with its own church and castle, as well as swamps and other Hexen-esque environments. The boss is the warlord responsible for this army - somebody who you may recognise.</text>
