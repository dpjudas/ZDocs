A 6 level replacement hub for hexen by Paul A. Thureen, and Charles Reis.

Story: After you had defeated the evil Korax, you thought it was over. But, in your dreams, you saw that he wasn't. His soul had escaped, and had infected other souls, and one of them was Alexander, your brother. Now, you face the grim task of having to search out Alexander, through the embattled waste lands known as Stonegate, the once all powerful and prosperous nation that he once ruled.</text>
