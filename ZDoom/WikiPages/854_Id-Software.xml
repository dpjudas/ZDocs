id Software was the creative force that made [[Doom]]. In particular, the members of id Software (some of whom are not necessarily part of the team anymore) that were responsible were:


*'''Programmers'''
**[[John Carmack]]
**Michael Abrash
**[[John Romero]]
**Dave Taylor

*'''Art'''&lt;br&gt;
**Adrian Carmack
**Kevin Cloud

*'''Biz'''
**Jay Wilbur

*'''Design'''
**Sandy Petersen
**[[John Romero]]
**American McGee
**Shawn Green


Special thanks are also granted to Tim Willits and John Anderson, who helped by making maps for the the fourth episode of Doom, Thy Flesh Consumed. [[Tom Hall]], although uncredited, also helped significantly as a mapper before leaving id.

The "id" in id Software is said to refer to a component of the human psyche, the force motivated by pleasure and greed alone, the dark side behind many of humanity's common drives.
