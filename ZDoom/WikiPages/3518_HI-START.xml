It is used to define high resolution textures that already exist and scale them according to the original texture. This is handy if you wish to create a wad which replaces the original game's textures with hi-res ones, no matter what size, without the use of typing up a [[TEXTURES]] lump.

Note that if you try to replace a non-existent texture, the image will be used unscaled as if it had been placed between the [[TX_START]] and [[TX_END]] markers (the same [[namespace]] is used). It is better practice, however, to put such textures between the proper markers.

If you are [[using ZIPs as WAD replacement]], the equivalent directory is "Hires".
