==Features==
*Launch ZDoom and its source ports quickly and easily.
*Never fiddle again for your IWADs: set their location once and they're always available.
*Slick interface.
*Manage your mods with a profile based system: just load your profile and you're ready to go.
*You can set and launch with a single click up to five of your favourite profiles.
*IWAD Identifier: got a WAD with a weird name, want to know what's in it or is it a duplicate? Just use the WAD Identifier.
*Free software (both as in beer and as in freedom!)
*Understandable and modular Lazarus/Free Pascal source! Create your own fork or enhance the launcher easily.
