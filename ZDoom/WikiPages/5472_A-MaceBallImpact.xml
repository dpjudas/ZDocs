'''A_MaceBallImpact'''&lt;br /&gt;
(no parameter)

If the calling actor has a health value different from a specific value (1234) and is in a bounce, reduces its vertical velocity to 75% of its value, changes its bounce type to "none", plays the "weapons/macebounce" sound and sets the actor back to its spawn state.

Otherwise (if health is set to that specific value, or if it isn't in a bounce), then it sets the calling actor's speed to 0 in all directions, gives it the NOGRAVITY flag, and plays the "weapons/macehit" sound.

This codepointer is meant to be used with projectiles using the "Heretic" or "HereticCompat" bounce types, as they put the bouncer in its death state during the bounce. This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|MaceFX1}} and actors inheriting from it.
