int '''GetAirSupply''' (int ''playernum'')

== Usage ==

Gives the amount of tics remaining in a player's air supply. This function targets only players since monsters do not have an air supply&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; drowning is not implemented for them.

=== Parameters ===

* ''playernum'': Player number. This information can be obtained through [[PlayerNumber]].

=== Return value ===

The duration in tics before the player will start to drown. A negative value tells the player is already drowning. Note that a negative value of 0 is possible by coincidence if the script is run at just the right tic, but is also used to mean there are no player for the given number.

== Examples ==

This example prints the number of seconds the player has until his or her air supply runs out.  It then prints a message warning the player to return for air.  Set this script to be executed by {{Class|SecActEyesDive|Eyes Go Below Surface}} and {{Class|SecActEyesSurface|Eyes Go Above Surface}} actors placed in your [[Transfer_Heights|'deep water']] sectors. 

 int print_air[8];
 
 script 1 (void)
 {
   print_air[&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;[[PlayerNumber]]()]++;
   print_air[&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;[[PlayerNumber]]()] %= 2;
   while (print_air[&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;[[PlayerNumber]]()])
   {
     if ([[GetAirSupply]]([[PlayerNumber]]()) &gt; 0)
       [[print]](i:[[GetAirSupply]]([[PlayerNumber]]()) / 35);
     else
       [[print]](s:"You'd better go up for air!");
       
     [[delay]](1);
   }
 }
