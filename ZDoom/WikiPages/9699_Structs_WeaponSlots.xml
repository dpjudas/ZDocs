The '''WeaponSlots''' [[Structs|struct]] contains functions that interact with [[Weapon slots|weapon slots]].

== Methods ==
All WeaponSlots methods are defined as ''native'', meaning their inner workings are handled on the C++ side of the engine.
=== Static ===
*{{c|static void}} '''SetupWeaponSlots'''(PlayerPawn ''pp'')
:Sets up weapon slots for the specified [[PlayerPawn]]. PlayerPawn actors call this function on themselves in their {{c|[[PostBeginPlay]]}}.

=== Dynamic ===
These methods have to be called on a pointer to a WeaponSlots instance. One is always created for each player and stored in the '''weapons''' field of their [[Structs:PlayerInfo|PlayerInfo]] struct. As such, these methods require the &lt;code&gt;player.weapons.&lt;/code&gt; prefix to be called.
*{{c|bool, int, int}} '''LocateWeapon'''(class&lt;Weapon&gt; ''weap'')
:Checks whether the specified weapon class is assigned to a slot. Has 3 return values:
::1. ''bool'' — true if the weapon is assigned to a slot
::2. ''int'' — the number of the slot the weapon is assigned to (from 0 to 9, but 0 is actually the 10th slot in order)
::3. ''int'' — the index of the weapon (i.e. its position in the slot, starting with 0).
*{{c|class&lt;Weapon&gt;}} '''GetWeapon'''(int ''slot'', int ''index'')
:Returns the class of a weapon in the specified slot and index.
*{{c|int}} '''SlotSize'''(int ''slot'')
:Returns the number of weapons assigned to the specified slot.
