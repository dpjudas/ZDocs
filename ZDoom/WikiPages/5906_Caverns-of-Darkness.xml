'''Caverns of Darkness''' is a mod originally created for a custom version of the [[Eternity Engine]], entitled "COD Engine", included in the archive. Because it uses non-standard effects, Caverns of Darkness cannot be played in most source ports. However, [[User:Graf Zahl|Graf Zahl]] created a compatibility patch that allows to play this mod in [[ZDoom]].

The "COD Engine" source code was released on May 4, 2002 by [[Christopher Lutz]]. Despite this, the source code was long considered lost, until it was re-released on May 26, 2019 by [[Joel Murdoch]], both then part of the Eternity team.

== ZDoom version ==
On January 23, 2005, [[Graf Zahl]] supplied a source modification called {{c|ZDOOM-COD.EXE}}, derived from [[ZDoom]] 2.0.96 that made the necessary additions to play ''Caverns of Darkness''. It reports in-game as ''ZDoom 2.0.96c (COD custom''). On November 15, 2008, he released a ''CoD'' PWAD patch to instead allow the levels to be played using the regular ZDoom build. It substitutes [[DECORATE]] actors in place of the original hard-coded custom thing types and weapons, as well as using [[MAPINFO]] to apply [[map translator]]s that replace the CoD engine's new sector and linedef typess.

== How to play this mod in ZDoom ==
# Download both the mod (cc_cod.zip) and the compatibility patch (cod_zd.zip) from the /idgames archives.
# Extract cod-zd.pk3 from cod_zd.zip.
# Extract COD.WAD and CODLEV.WAD from cc_cod.zip.
# Open cod-zd.pk3 with an archiver, then drag and drop COD.WAD and CODLEV.WAD inside.&lt;br&gt;[[File:Cod-zd.png|Thumb|360px]]
# You can now play cod-zd.pk3 as if it were a normal ZDoom mod.
