{{Special|201|tag, speed, height, target, flag|General BOOM linetype|Ceiling|type2=Ceiling}}
* ''tag'': Tag of affected sector, or 0 to use the sector on the back side of the line.
* ''speed'': Ceiling's [[Definitions#Sector_movement_speed|movement speed]].  Doom's standard ceilings move at 8, and fast crushers move at 16.
* ''height'': Distance to move (when ''target'' is 0).
* ''target'': How to determine the ceiling's destination height.
* ''flags'': Various flags; see below.

This special encapsulates BOOM's generalized ceilings.

== Parameters ==

=== Target ===
''target'' can be one of the following:

* 0: Move by ''height'' units
* 1: Move to highest neighboring ceiling
* 2: Move to lowest neighboring ceiling
* 3: Move to nearest neighboring ceiling
* 4: Move to highest neighboring floor
* 5: Move to the sector's own floor
* 6: Move by the height of the shortest upper texture on the sector

=== Flags ===
A moving ceiling may optionally copy its ceiling texture and [[Sector specials|special]] from a "model" sector.  There are two ways to choose a model sector.  The ''trigger model'' uses the sector on the front side of the line that caused the move.  The ''numeric model'' looks for neighboring sectors whose ceilings are at the destination height, and uses the one with the lowest-numbered shared linedef.  If no model sector can be found, nothing is copied.

''flags'' is composed of:

* 0: Don't copy anything
* 1: Copy ceiling texture, and remove special (Tx0)
* 2: Copy ceiling texture only (Tx)
* 3: Copy both ceiling texture and special (TxTy)
* +4: Use the numeric model (default is trigger model)
* +8: Raise ceiling (default is to lower)
* +16: Inflict crushing damage

== Conversions from linedef types ==
The following Doom map format types can be converted as Generic_Ceiling:
{| {{prettytable}}
!Type!!Conversion!!Trigger
|-
