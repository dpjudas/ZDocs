__NOTOC__

int '''CheckMonsterUseSpecials''' ([[Structs:Line|Line]] ''blocking'' = null)

== Usage ==
Checks if a monster can activate any lines it crossed recently.

=== Parameters ===
*''blocking'': The blocking line to check if the monster activated. Default is null, which means that the callers' ''BlockingLine'' is used. Can be the actors' actual ''MovementBlockingLine'' instead, or any other line pointer.

=== Return value ===
Returns the code for the action that occurred.
*0 - No lines were activated, either because there were none, they failed to activate, or the monster didn't have flags that allowed it/had flags that disabled it.
*1 - The line that was blocking the monster was activated.
*2 - A line that wasn't blocking the monster was activated.
