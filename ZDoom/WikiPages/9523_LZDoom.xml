'''LZDoom''' is a {{wp|Fork (software development)|fork}} of the [[GZDoom]] [[source port]] centered around lower-end computers by [[User:Drfrag|drfrag]]. LZDoom follows GZDoom's feature set and has a few enhancements of its own. It employs an {{wp|OpenGL 2}} based renderer, as GZDoom moved away to {{wp|OpenGL|OpenGL 3}} as a hardware requirement. LZDoom targets users still running with OpenGL 2.1 compatible graphics cards but who want to stay in touch with the latest in GZDoom development.

==History==
LZDoom was originally started as another legacy oriented build of GZDoom, built around version 3.3. Eventually, another one of drfrag's ports, [[GZDoom Vintage]] was merged into the existing codebase to create one new unified port under the same name. 

==Features==
* All features from latest version of mainline GZDoom ([[ACS]], [[ZScript]], [[ZMusic]] etc)
* All ZDoom features
* Rudimentary support for [[Doom Legacy]]
* Support for the [[DEHEXTRA]] standard
* OpenGL 2.1 based renderer (OpenGL 3.3+ recommended)
* 4 player splitscreen (LZDoom-exclusive)
* Options to switch between {{wp|Direct3D}} 9 and {{wp|DirectDraw}} rendering for software (Worldsim, backend)
* Several fixes to mods to maintain compatibility
====Merged features from QZDoom====
The [[QZDoom]] codebase enhancements partially also found their way into LZDoom. These include:
* Polygonal, 3-point perspective truecolor software renderer (“Softpoly”)
* Truecolor support for the classic 2-point renderer
* Vulkan renderer backend
* Proper windowed mode support (i.e. you can freely resize the game window)
* Correct ZDoom software light mode for the hardware renderer
* High resolution correct version of the software fuzz, for both software and hardware renderers
