    <text bytes="1861" sha1="0ssv7vd443axighr5du4mjt4u6dm158" xml:space="preserve">The UserCmd [[Structs|struct]] contains data related to the player's current inputs. This struct is defined as '''native''', meaning the internals are handled in the C++ part of the engine and custom versions of this struct cannot be created.

== Usage ==
Each player has their own UserCmd struct which is accessible with the &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt; field of the [[Structs:PlayerInfo|PlayerInfo struct]] of that player.

=== Fields ===
*{{c|uint '''buttons'''}}
:A bit field that contains the currently pressed buttons from [[#Buttons|the list below]].
:To check if a specific button is pressed, [[Operators_(ZScript)#Bitwise_operators|bitwise operators]] must be used, for example &lt;code&gt;if (&lt;playerInfoPointer&gt;.cmd.buttons &amp; BT_ATTACK)&lt;/code&gt; will return true if the Fire button is present among any other possible buttons.
*{{c|int16 '''pitch'''}}
:{{moreinfo}}
*{{c|int16 '''yaw'''}}
:{{moreinfo}}
*{{c|int16 '''roll'''}}
:{{moreinfo}}
*{{c|int16 '''forwardmove'''}}
:The value of the forward/backward input in the -32767–32767 range. The range is there to account for the possible use of analog input, like gamepads. Keyboard keys will just instantly go to the full value.
*{{c|int16 '''sidemove'''}}
:The value of the leftward/rightward input in the -32767–32767 range. The range is there to account for the possible use of analog input, like gamepads. Keyboard keys will just instantly go to the full value.
*{{c|int16 '''upmove'''}}
:The value of the downward/upward input in the -32767–32767 range. The range is there to account for the possible use of analog input, like gamepads. Keyboard keys will just instantly go to the full value.

=== Buttons ===
The &lt;code&gt;buttons&lt;/code&gt; field can contain the same internal button names as the ones that can be obtained by [[GetPlayerInput]]:
{{: Player input buttons}}
