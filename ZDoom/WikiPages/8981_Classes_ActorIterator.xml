ActorIterator is a lighter-in-comparison iterator compared to its brothers, [[ThinkerIterator]] and [[BlockThingsIterator]] which is much less resource intensive. However, actors require a TID in order for this to qualify them as part of the iteration. As such, a tid of 0 will not work at all.

== Functions ==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Return Type !! Function !! Arguments !! Use/Arguments
|-
| ActorIterator || '''Create''' {{deprecated}} || 
#int tid,
#class&lt;Actor&gt; type = "Actor"
|| 
'''Note''': as of GZDoom 4.0.0, this function has been deprecated in favor of &lt;code&gt;Level.CreateActorIterator&lt;/code&gt; (see [[Structs:LevelLocals#Dynamic|LevelLocals]]).
Initializes the iterator, searching for an actor of ''type'' and with the specific ''tid''. TID must not be 0.
*'''tid''' - The TID to search. Must not be 0 or it will not work.
*'''type''' - Serves as a filter. Specifying a classname here will only search for this type of actor and descendants. Default is Actor.
''Note: this function is static and should be called off the class name, i.e. ActorIterator.Create(...).''
|-
| Actor || '''Next''' || None || Cycles through the list of existing actors, filtered out by the '''Create()''' function.
|-
| void || '''Reinit''' || None || Restarts the search.
