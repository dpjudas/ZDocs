'''A_RaiseChildren''' [(int ''flags'')]

==Usage==
Resurrects the calling actor's children. Currently the only function that sets the necessary information is [[A_SpawnItemEx]].

===Parameters===
*''flags'': The following flags can be combined using the bit-wise OR operator (|):
**'''RF_TRANSFERFRIENDLINESS''' — the resurrected actors will change their affiliation to match that of the calling actor.
**'''RF_NOCHECKPOSITION''' — resurrect the actor without checking for room.

Monsters spawned with [[A_SpawnProjectile]] are not affected by this. [[A_SpawnProjectile]] was never designed to spawn monsters.

== Examples ==
The following is a variant of the {{Class|DoomImp|doom imp}}, a monster that spawns clones of itself. Its missile state uses [[A_Jump]] to decide on using one of two different attacks. Either spawning a clone, or triggering [[A_RaiseChildren]], reviving all clones that were already spawned and had died.
