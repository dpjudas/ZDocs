'''A_FPunchAttack'''&lt;br&gt;
(''no parameter'')&lt;br&gt;

Search for a possible target in a 90° cone in front of the calling player, starting right ahead and scanning rightwards up to 45°, then going back center and scanning leftwards up to -45°. The range for this attack is of 128 units, twice the default range for most melee attacks. If a target is found, the &lt;tt&gt;special1&lt;/tt&gt; counter is increased by one. The exact effects of the attack depend on the value of that counter.
* A value of less than three: the victim is dealt between 40 and 55 points of damage, is pushed back with a strength of two, and a {{Class|PunchPuff}} is used by the attack.
* A value of three: the victim is dealt between 80 and 110 points of damage, is pushed back with a strength of six, and a {{Class|HammerPuff}} is used by the attack. The counter is reset to 0, the weapon goes to its "Fire2" state, and the player plays the sound "*fistgrunt on the VOICE channel.

If the attack does not strike a creature or other attackable object, the counter is also reset to 0. A PunchPuff is spawned if it strikes a wall within 64 units (half the attack range of this function).

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|FWeapFist}} and derived classes.
