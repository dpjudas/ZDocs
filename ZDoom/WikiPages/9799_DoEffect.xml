{{c|virtual void '''DoEffect''' ()}}

== Usage ==
A [[ZScript virtual functions|virtual function]] called every [[tic|game tic]] by {{class|Inventory}} items as long as they're in an actor's inventory. It's similar to [[Tick]], except &lt;code&gt;Tick()&lt;/code&gt; is called every tic as long as the actor exists.

The &lt;code&gt;owner&lt;/code&gt; pointer can be utilized here to do something with the actor who is holding the item.

In the base {{class|Inventory}} class this function is empty. However, it's used in the {{class|Powerup}} class to constantly apply the powerup's effects to its owner.

{{Warning|The &lt;code&gt;owner&lt;/code&gt; pointer CAN become null while this function runs. This can notably happen if the owner dies and its Death [[Actor states|state sequence]] is 0 tics long: the items in their inventory will persist for one extra tic while the owner is null.}}

'''Note:''' This function will not be called if the owner has the {{flag|NOINTERACTION}} flag {{verification}}

== Examples ==
This item will restore 5 health to its ownner every second, similar to {{class|PowerRegeneration}}, but without duration or any other powerup effects:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="csharp"&gt;
class RegenerationItem : Inventory
{
    override void DoEffect()
    {
        Super.DoEffect();
        if (owner &amp;&amp; owner.health &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; GetAge() % TICRATE == 0)
        {
            owner.GiveBody(5);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

(See [[GiveBody]] and the [[Operators_(ZScript)#.25_.28modulo.29|ZScript modulo operator]] for extra information)
