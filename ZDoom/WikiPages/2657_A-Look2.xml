(no parameters)


Looks for players or other attackable actors in the game. This function is similar to [[A_Look]] but it only reacts to sound. Just seeing the player will not wake up a monster using this. This function must be used in the idle states of a monster.

The three states after this function call are reserved. You '''must''' include these states because the function jumps to the states following the call. '''A_Look2''' calls them randomly to animate actors using this function. The third of these states is only called when the '''{{flag|STANDSTILL}}''' flag is not set.

If you do not need that, [[A_TurretLook]] is the better solution.

== Examples ==

Some of [[Strife]]'s actors use this to check for gunfire. Here is code taken from the {{Class|Peasant}}.

 Spawn:
 	PEAS A 10 '''A_Look2'''
 	Loop

As you can see it is very similar to the [[A_Look#Examples|A_Look example]].</text>
