'''Odamex''' is a multiplayer-oriented port based on [[csDoom]] which obtained [[Randy Heit]]'s permission to relicense the ZDoom 1.22 code they've kept under the GPL. Because the source code for [[Heretic]] and [[Hexen]] was not under this license at the time, all the Raven Software code was removed (along with some code actually written by Randy which they could have kept).
