== Description ==
Hate Arena is a large empty arena with two sides. The premise of the WAD is for the player to summon monsters (using the summon [[Console|console]] cheat) on both sides to assign them “teams”. Once a monster has been summoned it remains dormant until you hit the start switch. Once the switch is hit the brawl begins as the teams battle it out. When one team is dead, all the monsters die and the arena is reset.

Hate Arena, while not being the most serious WAD, is a unique little “tool” which is fun to play around with or test newly made monsters on.</text>
