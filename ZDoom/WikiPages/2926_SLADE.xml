It is in active development, with version 3.1.0 currently available.

Version 3 is a fusion of SLADE and [[SLumpEd]]. The level editor has been implemented since 3.1.0, and it has been widely extended while both SLumpEd and [[XWE]] suffer from bugs and limitations.

==Features==
SLADE3 offers a range of features for ZDoom modding:
* All [[SLumpEd]] features and more
* Preview of all ZDoom [[font format]]s
* Support of all ZDoom [[image format]]s, including those used by the Hexen and Strife [[startup lumps]]
* Support for the ZDoom [[PNG]] chunks alPh and grAb
* Edition and conversion of [[ANIMATED]] and [[SWITCHES]] lumps to [[ANIMDEFS]] format
* Support for [[PK3|ZIP]] archives (only STORE and DEFLATE compression protocols at the moment)
* Full support for [[TEXTURES]] in the texture editor
* Support for [[UDMF]] as well as both Doom and Hexen binary [[map format]]s

=={{LE|Editor keys|DECORATE keys}}==
Like [[Doom Builder]], SLADE features a [[DECORATE]] parser used to obtain relevant information (such as [[editor number]], {{Property|Radius}}, {{Property|Height}}, {{Property|Scale}}, and so on) from custom actors. Additional information can be conveyed with keys in the form of special comments inserted within an actor's declaration block.

See [[Editor keys]] for a centralized full list.
