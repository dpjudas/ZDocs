While [[Predefined damage types|some damage types are predefined]], when it comes to creating new ones, there are practically no limitations on how many damage types an author can define or how they should be named.

For details on creating custom damage types, see [[Custom damage types (ZScript)|'''Custom damage types''']].

=== Defining damage types ===
Damage types can be defined as follows:
*In actors, using their '''{{property|DamageType}}''' property. This is normally done in [[Projectile|projectiles]] or [[Puff|puffs]]. For example, &lt;code&gt;DamageType 'Fire'&lt;/code&gt; will define the actor's damage type. 
*They can also be defined globally in '''[[MAPINFO/Damage type definition|MAPINFO]]'''.

&lt;u&gt;Simply defining damage types doesn't create any behaviors on its own&lt;/u&gt;. However, damage types can be bound to '''damage factors'''. Damage factors can modify the amount of damage a specific actor ''receives'' from a specific damage source.

=== Defining damage factors ===
Damage factors can be defined as follows:
*In actors, using their '''{{property|DamageFactor}}''' property. This is normally done in [[Monster|monsters]]. For example, &lt;code&gt;DamageFactor 'Fire', 2.0&lt;/code&gt; will make the actor receive 200% damage from any source that has &lt;code&gt;DamageType 'Fire'&lt;/code&gt; attached to it.
*They can also be defined globally in '''[[MAPINFO/Damage type definition|MAPINFO]]'''.

In addition to that, custom Pain and Death [[Actor states]] can be defined that will be used by the actor if it's damaged by a specific damage type (note, the actor's {{property|DamageFactor}} does not have to be defined for this to work, as long as it's not 0 for this specific damage type). For example, if you add a '''Pain.Fire''' state sequence to your actor, it will be used instead of the default '''Pain''' when it's hit by an actor with &lt;code&gt;DamageType 'Fire'&lt;/code&gt;.
