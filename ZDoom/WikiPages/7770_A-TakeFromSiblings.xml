int '''A_TakeFromSiblings''' (string ''type'' [, int ''count''])

==Usage==
Removes ''count'' items of type ''type'' from the calling actor's ''siblings''' inventory. The minimum amount of item of a type in an inventory is zero, removing a greater amount than what a ''sibling'' actually possesses will not result in a negative amount.

An actor's ''siblings'' are actors which share a common ''master'' actor with said actor. These ''siblings'' are considered the ''children'' of the ''master''. This relationship is formed when those ''children'' actors are spawned by the ''master'' actor through {{c|[[A_SpawnItemEx]]}} with the SXF_SETMASTER flag passed to the function.

===Parameters===
*''type'': the item to take. This should be a valid {{Class|Inventory|inventory item}}.
*''count'': the number of samples of this item to take. If this is 0 or a value which is equal to or greater than the number of samples in the inventory, the item is cleared from the inventory unless it has the {{Flag|INVENTORY.KEEPDEPLETED}} flag set, and in which case, its amount is merely reduced to 0. Default is 0.

===Return value===
The function returns the total number of ''sibling'' actors which have one or more samples of ''type'' (before attempting removal) in their inventory.
