'''A_RaiseSiblings''' [(int ''flags'')]

==Usage==
Resurrects the calling actor's siblings. Currently the only function that sets the necessary information is [[A_SpawnItemEx]].

===Parameters===
*''flags'': The following flags can be combined using the bit-wise OR operator (|):
**'''RF_TRANSFERFRIENDLINESS''' — the resurrected actors will change their affiliation to match that of the calling actor.
**'''RF_NOCHECKPOSITION''' — resurrect the actors without checking for room.

Monsters spawned with [[A_SpawnProjectile]] are not affected by this. [[A_SpawnProjectile]] was never designed to spawn monsters.

== Examples ==
The following is a variant of the {{Class|DoomImp|doom imp}}, a monster whose sole purpose is to revive its master and siblings through its own death. When killed, its death state triggers [[A_RaiseSiblings]], reviving all of the other monsters who were spawned by its master.
 ACTOR SacrificialImp : {{Class|DoomImp}}
 {
   States
   {
   Death:
     TROO I 8 
     TROO J 8 [[A_Scream]]
     TROO K 6 [[A_RaiseMaster]]
     TROO K 0 [[A_RaiseSiblings]]
     TROO L 6 [[A_NoBlocking]]
     TROO M -1
     Stop
   }
 }
