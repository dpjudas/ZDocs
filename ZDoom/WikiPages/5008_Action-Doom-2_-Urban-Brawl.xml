== About ==
''Action Doom 2: Urban Brawl'' is the prequel to [[Action Doom]]. This time the gameplay has changed to a more melee combat-oriented style of play. It has many classic beat-'em-up style features such as enemy name and health bars. ''Action Doom 2'' has a unique cartoon art style. Rather than focusing on being a Doom modification, ''Action Doom 2'' is more of a stand alone game with completely original resources.

Bonus content is available on the official website, featuring several minigames presented as episodes.

''Action Doom 2'' received one of the 15th Annual [[Cacoward]]s.
