'''A_SorcFX2Split'''&lt;br&gt;
(''no parameter'')&lt;br&gt;

Spawns two actors of the caller's class at the location of the calling actor and destorys the caller.  The caller's target is transferred to both actors and their special1 is set to the caller's angle.  One SorceFX2 has its first argument set to 0 (clockwise) and the other set to 1 (counter-clockwise).  Both actors are set to their Orbit state.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|SorcFX2}} and derived classes.</text>
