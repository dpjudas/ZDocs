'''[[Classes:Actor|Actor]]'''

virtual bool '''CanResurrect''' (Actor ''other'', bool ''passive'')

==Usage==
Called in the actor resurrection code, and serves as an additional condition to pass for the resurrection process to succeed. In the chain of conditions, it is called last, once for the "resurrectee" (the actor being resurrected) and another for the "raiser" (the actor doing the act of resurrection). In the event an actor is resurrecting itself, i.e. it is both the resurrectee and raiser, the function is only called once.

===Parameters===
*''other'': a pointer to the raiser or resurrectee, depending on the ''passive'' parameter.
*''passive'': if this is ''false'', ''other'' points to the resurrectee, otherwise it points to the raiser.

===Return value===
The return value is a boolean that is used to mark the success or failure of the check. In the case the function is called twice, once for each of the actors involved, both calls need to return ''true'' for the resurrection process to succeed. If at least one of the calls returns ''false'', the resurrection process as a whole fails.

==Predefined functionality==
If not overridden, all the function does is return ''true''.

==Examples==
If it is low on health, this {{Class|archvile}} can only resurrect "low-level" [[monster]]s.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="csharp"&gt;
class ExampleArchvile : ArchVile
{
    override bool CanResurrect (Actor other, bool passive)
    {
        if (!passive)
        {
            return (health &gt;= SpawnHealth() / 3 || other.SpawnHealth() &lt;= 200);
        }

        return true;
    }
}&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
