== Description ==
[[File:teitenga2.jpg|thumb|An Irradiated Area.]]
'''Assault on Tei Tenga''' is the first recorded instance of a multi-map [[hub]] for [[Doom]]. It takes advantage of many of the [[ZDoom]] features that were prevalent at the time of the mod's original release in 1999. It is "mission-driven", has six maps in the hub, uses new resources, and is loosely based around a story-line. The gameplay deviates from the standard key or switch hunt found in Doom mods of the time. To make progress, you need to vent radiation from a critical area, align the main radio antenna to broadcast a signal, refuel an escape vehicle, and perform many other tasks. The game uses a variety of [[ACS|scripts]] to create a sense of doing real things in a real place.

== Story ==

[[File:teitenga3.jpg|thumb|Inside the Space Station.]]
From the text file: "You're on your way out to some R&amp;R when General Burns diverts your shuttle to Tei Tenga to investigate a loss of communications...." The events surrounding your mission to Tei Tenga are gradually revealed though computer log records that you can access throughout the game.
 
== Reception ==

For its time, the mod was ground-breaking. The WAD was also one of the ten 1999 mods to feature in the [[Top 100 WADs of All Time]] on [[Doomworld]].</text>
