'''A_FireSigil1'''&lt;br&gt;
(''no parameter'')&lt;br&gt;

Plays the sound "weapon/sigilcharge" on the Weapon channel, and takes 4 health points from the player and then spawns a {{Class|SpectralLightningSpot}} at either the point of the player's target or the player itself.  If it spawns at the target's position, the tracer property is set to the target.  If it spawns at the player's position the velocity is set to 28 in the direction the player is facing.  The spawned actor's health is also set to -1.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|Sigil}} and derived classes.</text>
