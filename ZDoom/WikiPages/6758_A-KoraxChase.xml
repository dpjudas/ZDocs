'''A_KoraxChase'''

(no parameters)

==Usage==

If the calling actor's &lt;tt&gt;special2&lt;/tt&gt; field is null and its {{Property|Health|health}} is reduced to half or less its starting value, teleports to the first destination with [[TID]] 248 and starts [[ACS]] script 249. The &lt;tt&gt;special2&lt;/tt&gt; field is then set to 1 to avoid using this effect more than once per actor.

If the calling actor has no valid target, the function does nothing else.

Otherwise, it has a 30/256 chance of setting the calling actor to its Missile state, and if not, another 30/256 chance of playing the sound "KoraxActive" on the VOICE channel.

Afterwards, if the calling actor's health is reduced to half or less its starting value, it has a 10/256 chance of teleporting to the next destination with TID 249. These teleportations are done in sequence, using the calling actor's &lt;tt&gt;tracer&lt;/tt&gt; field to store the current choice.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|Korax}} and derived classes.
