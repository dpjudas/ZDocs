(no parameter)&lt;br&gt;

Calls [[A_NoBlocking]]. If the calling actor is the last of its type on the map, and there is at least one living player, does a number of other things, depending on the calling actor's nature:
*{{Class|AlienSpectre1}} ({{Class|Programmer|The Programmer}}'s spectre): performs [[Floor_LowerToLowest]] on sector tagged 999, plays the sound "svox/voc95" on the VOICE channel, and sets the player's log to 95.
*{{Class|AlienSpectre2}} ({{Class|StrifeBishop|The Bishop}}'s spectre): prints the "TXT_KILLED_BISHOP" string ("You Killed The Bishop!"), gives the player a {{Class|QuestItem21}}, plays the sound "svox/voc74" on the VOICE channel, and sets the player's log to 74.
*{{Class|AlienSpectre3}} ({{Class|Oracle|The Oracle}}'s spectre): performs [[Door_Open]] on sector tagged 222 with a speed of 8 units, prints the "TXT_KILLED_ORACLE" string ("You've Killed The Oracle!"), kills all remaining {{Class|Oracle}} actors, and gives the player a {{Class|QuestItem23}}. If the player also has a {{Class|QuestItem21}}, gives it a {{Class|QuestItem22}} as well. If the player has a {{Class|QuestItem24}} in inventory, plays the sound "svox/voc85" on the VOICE channel, and sets the player's log to 85. Otherwise, plays the sound "svox/voc87" and sets the player's log to 87.
*{{Class|AlienSpectre4}} ({{Class|Macil2|Macil}}'s spectre): Prints the "TXT_KILLED_MACIL" string ("You Killed Macil!") and gives the player a {{Class|QuestItem24}}. If the player has a {{Class|QuestItem25}}, plays the sound "svox/voc106" on the VOICE channel, and sets the player's log to 106. Otherwise, plays the sound "svox/voc79" and sets the player's log to 79.
*{{Class|AlienSpectre5}} ({{Class|Loremaster|The Loremaster}}'s spectre): performs [[Floor_LowerToLowest]] on sector tagged 666, prints the "TXT_KILLED_LOREMASTER" string ("You've Killed the Loremaster!"), gives the player a {{Class|QuestItem26}} and, if not in multiplayer, both an {{Class|UpgradeAccuracy}} and an {{Class|UpgradeStamina}}. If the player has a {{Class|Sigil}} with five pieces, plays the sound "svox/voc85" on the VOICE channel, and sets the player's log to 85. Otherwise, plays the sound "svox/voc83" and sets the player's log to 83.
*Any other class: does nothing else.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|AlienSpectre1}} and derived classes.</text>
