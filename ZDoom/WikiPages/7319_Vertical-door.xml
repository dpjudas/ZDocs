Opening and closing the door is done with one of the [[:Category:Door specials|door specials]]. While opening, the door's ceiling gradually moves up to 4 map units below the lowest neighboring ceiling (for this reason, two different door sectors cannot touch).

Vertical doors can be either "manual" or "remote". A manual door is when the door [[sector]] is the activating [[linedef]]'s back sector, rather than a [[tag]]ged sector. A remote door is any door activated from its tag. The main gameplay difference between both is that a manual door can be retriggered repeatedly while it is moving, forcing an opening door to close or a closing door to reopen; while a remote door cannot be retriggered until it has completed its movement.

The vertical door is the Doom engine's basic door. ''[[Hexen]]'' introduced [[polyobject]]s, allowing to have swinging and sliding doors; and ''[[Strife]]'' introduced [[animated door]]s.
