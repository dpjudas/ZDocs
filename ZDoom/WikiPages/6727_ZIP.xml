    <text bytes="1878" sha1="mfc9eioyn0kj60c5e2gxdxbe1hscqwc" xml:space="preserve">The '''ZIP''' file format is a standard container format developed by {{wp|PKWARE,_Inc|PKWARE}} and allowing a large number of compression methods. This is an open and widely used standard; however it is very seldom implemented fully.

The standard defines the following compression methods (bolded methods are supported by ZDoom):
  '''0 - The file is stored (no compression)'''
  '''1 - The file is Shrunk'''
  2 - The file is Reduced with compression factor 1
  3 - The file is Reduced with compression factor 2
  4 - The file is Reduced with compression factor 3
  5 - The file is Reduced with compression factor 4
  '''6 - The file is Imploded'''
  '''8 - The file is Deflated'''
  9 - Enhanced Deflating using Deflate64(tm)
 10 - PKWARE Data Compression Library Imploding (old IBM TERSE)
 '''12 - File is compressed using BZIP2 algorithm'''
 '''14 - LZMA (EFS)'''
 18 - File is compressed using IBM TERSE (new)
 19 - IBM LZ77 z Architecture (PFS)
 97 - WavPack compressed data
 98 - PPMd version I, Rev 1
Each file in a ZIP archive can be compressed with a different method. In practice, ZIP implementation is generally limited to only formats 0 (stored) and 8 (deflated).

[[ZDoom]] and [[zipdir]] both support methods 0 (stored), 1 (shrunk), 6 (imploded), 8 (deflated), 12 (bzipped 2) and 14 (LZMA, also used by the 7z format). As of 2009, when {{forum|t=22004|support for Shrunk and Implode was added}}, all the zip files on the [[Idgames archive]] can be opened successfully by ZDoom (unsupported methods are not used).

The implementation in ZDoom is based on the {{wp|zlib}} library by Jean-Loup Gailly and Mark Adler.
