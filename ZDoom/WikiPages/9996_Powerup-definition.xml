    <comment>Created page with "One of the many powerups, i.e. items based on the {{class|Powerup}} class. While an item of this class is placed in an actor's inventory, the actor will be affected by it. Usually powerups are given through a {{class|PowerupGiver}}, but they can be given directly as well (see [[Classes:Powerup#Powerup_and_PowerupGiver|'''here''']] for more details).&lt;noinclude&gt;  [[Category:Include templates]]"</comment>
