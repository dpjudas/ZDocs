{{c|native void '''TraceBleedAngle'''(int ''damage'', double ''angle'', double ''pitch'')}}

== Usage ==
Draws a blood [[decal]] from the calling actor. In contrast to '''[[TraceBleed]]''', this version allows specifying a direction towards which the decal should be placed.

Does not spawn blood actors (for that see '''[[SpawnBlood]]''').

=== Parameters ===
*{{c|int '''damage'''}}
:The amount of damage that was dealt by the attack. Note, this does NOT deal any damage; this number is only used to determine how many and what type of blood decals to draw.
*{{c|double '''angle'''}}
:The absolute angle towards the direction where the decal should be placed.
*{{c|double '''pitch'''}}
:The absolute pitch towards the direction where the decal should be placed.
