int '''GetInvasionState''' (void)

== Usage ==

Returns the state of the current invasion game. This can be used to execute special scripts when an invasion game meets a certain condition.

=== Return value ===

The current state of the invasion. For readability there are definitions defined in Skulltag's zdefs.acs as follows:

{{Warning|text=The following information is based on assumption and may not be correct! If you can confirm that the following is correct, please remove this warning from the article.}}


*'''IS_WAITINGFORPLAYERS''' = 0
:The invasion has not started and it is waiting for players to join the game.
*'''IS_FIRSTCOUNTDOWN''' = 1
:The countdown is in progress for the first wave.
*'''IS_INPROGRESS''' = 2
:The invasion is in progress (any wave).
*'''IS_BOSSFIGHT''' = 3
:The invasion is on a boss fight.
*'''IS_WAVECOMPLETE''' = 4
:The wave has just finished.
*'''IS_COUNTDOWN''' = 5
:The countdown for the next wave is in progress.
*'''IS_MISSIONFAILED''' = 6
:The mission failed or all players died.

'''NOTE:''' If and only if Invasion is not enabled, then a value of &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt; will return instead.

==Examples==
This script checks when the first invasion wave has finished and then prints a message.
 script 1 open
 {
 while (( [[GetInvasionWave]]() != 1 ) || ( GetInvasionState( ) != IS_COUNTDOWN ))
 delay(1);
 [[PrintBold]](s:"Well done! The next wave is even harder. Good luck!");
