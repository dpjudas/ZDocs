'''Footsteps''' are a player feature that allows players' to make footstep sounds on [[TERRAIN]] flats, and to also spawn terrain splashes, if any are defined, based on the players' mass. The frequency of steps and splashes are also affected based on if the player is walking or running, Allowing for SFX like players making metal stepping sounds when moving over a metal texture, or making water splashes when going over water. Players need to have the {{flag|PLAYERPAWN.MAKEFOOTSTEPS|MAKEFOOTSTEPS}} flag set for footsteps to play. It can be modified through [[ZScript]] with the [[MakeFootsteps]] virtual method.

The sound of footsteps can also be controlled by the {{c|{{CVAR|S|snd_footstepvolume}}}} [[console variable]], which functions as a multiplier. i.e if it is 0.5, footsteps will play at half volume.
