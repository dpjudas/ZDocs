== About ==
''Harmony'' is a standalone game for ZDoom inspired by vintage FPS such as Doom or Duke Nukem 3D. The plot is simple: after a new world war, a plague turned men into aggressive mutants. Women for some reason are not affected by the pandemic, but they're not immune to being kidnapped by the mutants for sinister purposes... This is precisely what just happened to an "Amazon" named Amira, and her friend Harmony is trying to rescue her from the mutants' clutches.

The game comprises eleven maps. All sprites and textures are new, made specifically for this game by Thomas van der Velden. The monster sprites were created from photographs of clay sculptures with a unique art style.
