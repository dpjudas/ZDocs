== Description ==
The ZDoom Community Map Project (ZDCMP) is a WAD created by many members of the ZDoom Community. It contains a large single map which was created by passing the file on to each mapper and adding a new area to the level. The WAD contains almost every exclusive ZDoom feature that was available at the time (New monsters, slopes, fake sector over sectors etc), and is a great example of what ZDoom can do. It also uses a few new monsters which are now available in the "[[Realm 667|Beastiary]]".

A sequel had been planned, then subsequently cancelled, then resurrected again in [[The ZDoom Community Map Project "Take 2"]]. The "Take 1" won a [[Cacoward]] at the [http://www.doomworld.com/11years/ 11th Cacowards].
