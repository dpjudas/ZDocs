The Exclamation Mark is displayed when there is an error in the map which involves actors. The possibility for this could be a missing sprite for an actor's Spawn state, or an [[Classes:Unknown|incorrect/unused DoomEdNum]] in the map. An error is usually printed to the console in this case.

[[Skulltag]] also uses this icon for a "medal" for getting killed 5 times without fragging anyone else with the phrase "You Fail it", which is now a common phrase used in the Doom community.

The [[Eternity Engine]], although not derived from ZDoom, adopted it as well. Notably, it displays it (with some translucency added) in places where map authors have left a [[Doom Builder]] {{Class|DoomBuilderCamera|3D preview camera}}.

[[User:Randy Heit|Randy]] drew this icon with Microsoft Paint.
