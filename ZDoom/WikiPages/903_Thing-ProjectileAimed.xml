{{Special|178|tid, type, speed, target, newtid|Thing|ProjectileAimed}}

* ''tid'': Thing ID of the map spot to spawn the projectile at 
* ''type'': Type of projectile to spawn
: When using this special on a [[linedef]] or a [[thing]] in [[UDMF]], you can use the {{c|arg1str}} property to define a class name instead of the {{c|arg1}} property to define a spawn number.
* ''speed'': Speed of the projectile in units per 8 tics
* ''target'': Thing ID of the thing you want the projectile fired at
* ''newtid'': TID you want assigned to the spawned projectile (optional)

Spawns a projectile that is fired at a target which can be any thing on the map. Note that this special requires the actor being spawned to have a SpawnID. To spawn an actor without one, use the [[SpawnProjectile]] function instead.

== Usage ==

''tid'' is a number that makes a thing unique, the default is zero, and therefore a TID is usually set to something else, like 1. In Doom Builder you have to right click on a thing, select the “Effects” tab and change the Thing Tag to something besides 0.

The ''type'' is actually from the list of [[Spawn_numbers]]. You can either use the number or the defined name ('''T_SOMETHING''') for clarity.

''speed'' is a number between 0&amp;ndash;255.

''target'' TID is the same idea as the TID above, to see an example of changing the players TID check out [[Thing_ChangeTID]].

''newtid'' is just a way to make the spawned thing unique if you need to refer to it later. It is just a number.</text>
