In other words, the fixed point representation of a number is that number times 65536.

To do multiplies and divides on fixed point numbers in [[ACS]] scripts, you can use functions such as [[FixedMul]] and [[FixedDiv]].

You can convert an integer to a fixed point representation of that integer simply by shifting your desired integer left 16 bits:

  int myCoolInteger = 72;
  int myCoolFixedPointValue = myCoolInteger &lt;&lt; 16; //Result is 4718592

Going the other way is just as easy...

  int myCoolFixedPointValue = 4718592;
  int myCoolInteger = myCoolFixedPointValue &gt;&gt; 16; //Result is 72

You can also specify fixed point numbers as literals in ACS scripts:

  int myFixedPointNumber = 1.5;

myFixedPointNumber is now (1.5 * 65536) = 98304. If an integer value is intended, you ''must'' use a decimal point e.g. 4.0 or use the left shift described above; ACS does not know what type a number is supposed to be.
