== Description ==
Welcome to Caco's Kid Monster Pizzeria. Take your little growing creatures here and let them learn how to become a good monsters with entertainment with the monster animatronics: Caco, Pinky, Impy, and Skeleton. When it's closing time, you, the startled security guard, stay on night shift to make sure everything is under control. But the animatronics seem to not like the dark. They will become active and search for the brightest light...which is your security office. They will scare anyone to take all the light they can to be safe. Now, it's on you to defend yourself and prevent the animatronics from entering the office with you in it for 5 nights. Good luck and have fun with your new job at Caco's Kid Monster Pizzeria.</text>
