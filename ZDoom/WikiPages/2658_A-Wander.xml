void '''A_Wander''' [(int ''flags'')]

== Usage ==
Makes the actor wander around aimlessly, as used by [[Strife]]'s [[Classes:Peasant|peasants]]. An actor will not play active sounds, attack players, or attack any other target when calling this function, unlike [[A_Chase]]. '''A_Wander''' does nothing when the actor calling it has the '''{{flag|STANDSTILL}}''' flag set. For {{flag|FRIENDLY|friendly}} monsters, the default behavior of this function is to make them follow the player. To make friendly monsters calling this function actually wander around instead, you should use the {{flag|DONTFOLLOWPLAYERS}} flag.

== Parameters ==
*''flags'': The following flags can be combined using the | symbol:
** '''CHF_NORANDOMTURN''' - Actor will not attempt to turn during their chasing frames at random. They will only turn when they encounter an obstacle.
** '''CHF_NODIRECTIONTURN''' - Actor will not turn its angle to face the direction of travel.
** '''CHF_STOPIFBLOCKED''' - Actor cannot turn away from obstacles blocking it. It will simply not move, but can still angle itself.

:* '''CHF_DONTTURN''' - Implies CHF_NORANDOMTURN and CHF_STOPIFBLOCKED.

== Examples ==

Here is an example of an {{Class|DoomImp|Imp}} that wanders around randomly looking for players.

 actor ImpScout : {{Class|DoomImp}}
 {
 States {
   Spawn:
     TROO AA 3 '''A_Wander'''
     TROO A 0 [[A_Look]]
     TROO BB 3 '''A_Wander'''
     TROO B 0 [[A_Look]]
     TROO CC 3 '''A_Wander'''
     TROO C 0 [[A_Look]]
     TROO DD 3 '''A_Wander'''
     TROO D 0 [[A_Look]]
     loop
  }
 }

[[A_Look]] has to repeatedly be called to check for players while it is wandering around.
It is also interesting that A_Wander can be in a different way used.
This {{Class|Cacodemon}} for example is able to teleport, but it's not a real teleport. It just gets invisible and walks around for 0 tics and gets
visible again:

 actor TeleCaco : {{Class|Cacodemon}}
 {
 States {
    See:
     HEAD A 0 [[A_Jump]](16,"Tele")
     HEAD A 4 [[A_Chase]]
     loop
    Tele:
     HEAD A 1 [[A_SetRenderStyle]](0.8, STYLE_Translucent)
     HEAD A 1 [[A_SetRenderStyle]](0.6, STYLE_Translucent)     
     HEAD A 1 [[A_SetRenderStyle]](0.4, STYLE_Translucent)
     HEAD A 1 [[A_SetRenderStyle]](0.2, STYLE_Translucent)
     TNT1 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 0 '''A_Wander'''
     HEAD A 1 [[A_SetRenderStyle]](0.2, STYLE_Translucent)
     HEAD A 1 [[A_SetRenderStyle]](0.4, STYLE_Translucent)
     HEAD A 1 [[A_SetRenderStyle]](0.6, STYLE_Translucent)
     HEAD A 1 [[A_SetRenderStyle]](0.8, STYLE_Translucent)
     HEAD A 1 [[A_SetRenderStyle]](1.0, STYLE_Translucent)
     Goto See
  }
 }
