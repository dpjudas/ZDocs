'''A_JabDagger'''

(no parameters)

[[Strife]]'s standard {{Class|PunchDagger|dagger}} attack. This checks whether the player has the {{Class|Berserk|berserk effect}} by looking for the presence of a {{Class|PowerStrength}} item in the inventory. Damage formula is (''power'' + 2) * random(0, ''power'' + 7), multiplied again by 10 when berserk, and where ''power'' is equal to one tenth of the player's {{Class|UpgradeStamina|stamina}} with a maximal cap at 10.

The attack is a short-range [[hitscan]] attack, with a maximum spread of 5.625Â°. It uses {{Class|StrifeSpark}} puffs and plays on the WEAPON channel the sound "misc/swish" in case of a miss, "misc/metalhit" when hitting actors with the {{Flag|NOBLOOD}} flag, and "misc/meathit" otherwise. Contrarily to most weapons, the dagger only alerts the target, rather than all actors within earshot.

Struck targets are always unconditionally put into their pain state. (If a Pain.Dagger state is defined, this is used instead. )

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|PunchDagger}} and actors inheriting from it.
