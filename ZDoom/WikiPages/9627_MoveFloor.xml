[[Structs:Sector|Sector]]

native int '''MoveFloor'''(double ''speed'', double ''dest'', int ''crush'', int ''direction'', bool ''hexencrush''[, bool ''instant''])

== Usage ==
Moves the floor of the Sector along with any attached sectors and Actors in it. This is what ZDoom's raising and lowering floors use to change the map geometry.

'''Note:''' Any movement done this way will not have interpolation. A [[Classes:MovingFloor|MovingFloor]] must be used to get this effect.

=== Parameters ===
*''speed'' - The amount to move by. This should be positive with ''direction'' determining which way to move.
*''dest'' - The destination distance from the world origin to cap movement to. Note that this is ''not'' the z position in the map. See [[PointToDist]] for converting a height to a distance.
*''crush'' - The amount of damage to deal if a damageable Actor blocked its movement. Setting to -1 will stop the floor from continuing to move.
*''direction'' - The direction to move vertically. 1 is up and -1 is down.
*''hexencrush'' - If set to true, stop the floor's movement even if ''crush'' isn't -1.
*''instant'' - If set to true, vertical interpolation for any Actors on the floor is disabled when doing the movement. Default is false.

=== Return value ===
Returns the result of the floor movement. This can be one of three values:
*'''Sector.MOVE_OK''' - The floor movement had no issues.
*'''Sector.MOVE_CRUSHED''' - Something was blocking the floor's movement.
*'''Sector.MOVE_PASTDEST''' - The floor reached its destination.
