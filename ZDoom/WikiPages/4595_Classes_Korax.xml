}}[[Classes]]: &lt;u&gt;Korax&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Korax, the middle brother of the three Serpent Riders, is far more powerful than his cadet [[Classes:Sorcerer2|D'Sparil]]. Within his castle, he uses the [[ACS|magic of the Chaos Sphere]] to summon hordes of phantasmal monsters ([[Classes:EttinMash|ettins]], [[Classes:CentaurMash|centaurs]], and [[Classes:Demon1|chaos]] [[Classes:Demon2|serpents]]) and trigger all sorts of traps against his foe.

==== Using Korax in a map ====

Korax, like his brother and the [[Classes:Dragon|death wyvern]], is a monster that should not be used in a map without the proper accommodations. Korax will call several [[ACS]] scripts and these scripts require several reserved [[TID]]s:

===== Korax scripts =====
This does not explain the exact details of what the scripts do in MAP40 of Hexen.wad, and instead merely overview quickly what type of effects they have so that a modder might provide equivalent scripts that will be activated by Korax.
:''249'': Started by [[A_KoraxChase]] when Korax's health is reduced to half its full value. Used by Korax to retreat to safety until all ettins are killed.
:''250'': Randomly started by [[A_KoraxCommand]]. Activates a series of [[Classes:ThrustFloorDown|spikes]].
:''251'': Randomly started by [[A_KoraxCommand]]. Temporarily turns the floor to lava and spawns a number of [[Classes:FireBall|fireballs]].
:''252'': Randomly started by [[A_KoraxCommand]]. Provokes an [[earthquake]] and opens doors to rooms full of [[Classes:Demon1|chaos serpents]] and [[Classes:Bishop|dark bishops]].
:''253'': Randomly started by [[A_KoraxCommand]]. Temporarily lowers four cross-shaped devices that throw a large number of [[Classes:FireBall|fireballs]].
:''254'': Randomly started by [[A_KoraxCommand]] if Korax is severely wounded. Provokes an earthquake and spawns a [[Classes:Demon1Mash|randomly]]-[[Classes:Demon2Mash|chosen]] [[Classes:EttinMash|phantasmal]] [[Classes:CentaurMash|monster]] on a randomly-chosen spawn point.
:''255'': Death script started by [[A_KoraxBonePop]]. Provokes an earthquake and opens the door to the end of level.

===== Korax TIDs =====
:''245'': Korax himself, used by script 249 and as the center point of the earthquake by all control scripts.
:''248'': Initial teleport destination, used by [[A_KoraxChase]] when his health is lowered to one half.
:''249'': Secondary teleport destinations, used by [[A_KoraxChase]] after the first teleportation
TIDs 250 to 255 are marked as reserved for the same-numbered scripts in the source code, but aren't actually used by the ACS in the map.
