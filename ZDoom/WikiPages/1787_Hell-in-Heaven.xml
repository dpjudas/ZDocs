It will involve something that hasn't really been attempted before in Doom, putting in a metaphorical "Heaven".

The story so far...

UAC Scientists on Earth try to reconcile the past crimes of the UAC by creating a portal to Heaven instead of Hell, but unfortunately they did both. Demons from Hell crossed over to Heaven and Earth and now the great grandson of the marine that fixed the first mess has to fix this mess too.

There will be 31 levels with 1 secret level, unless I can figure out how to add more than 32 levels in a WAD.

This is a message to Joe Capricorn. If you are using Doom Builder, you can name your maps. Type Map33, Map00, 999, you can name the map whatever you wish.
