    <text bytes="3002" sha1="ibmybwin4ud08bniye7i0kr6zg8nuwb" xml:space="preserve">The '''frozen death''' is an effect originating from ''[[Hexen]]''. [[Player]]s and [[monster]]s in that game have a dedicated {{c|Ice}} [[state]], which is reached when they are killed by a [[weapon]], [[projectile]] or [[puff]] using the {{c|Ice}} [[damage type]].

[[ZDoom]] generalized the effect with a {{c|GenericFreezeDeath}} used by [[actor]]s without their own {{c|Ice}} state. To do so, the [[A_GenericFreezeDeath]] codepointer, which gives the frozen actor the prebuild "ice" [[translation]]. 

Both A_GenericFreezeDeath and [[A_FreezeDeath]] turn the victim into an ice corpse. An ice corpse gains the following flags: {{Flag|CANPASS}}, {{Flag|ICECORPSE}}, {{Flag|NOBLOOD}}, {{Flag|PUSHABLE}}, {{Flag|SHOOTABLE}}, {{Flag|SLIDESONWALLS}}, {{Flag|SOLID}} and {{Flag|TELESTOMP}}. The [[fuzz]] or [[stealth]] effect is also removed, and the victim's [[special]] is executed.

A falling actor turned into an ice corpse will never enter the Crash state. In addition, ice corpses can be [[A_Blast|blasted]], while regular corpses cannot.

Ice corpses are shattered into {{Class|IceChunk}}s by the [[A_FreezeDeathChunks]] function if they call it while being perfectly motionless (all velocities are NULL). To make sure that this happens eventually, every ice death state should end with a looping call to A_FreezeDeathChunks.

Certain situations are meant to trigger instant shattering, and they do this by setting the ice corpse's velocities to zero as well as changing its [[tic]] count before the next state change to 1. These situations include:
*Being crushed by [[sector]] movement, such as a closing door.
*Landing on a floor with a falling velocity greater than eight map units per tic.
*Receiving any amount of damage, unless the [[damage type]] is {{c|Ice}}.

If a player pawn dies a frozen death, a blue [[palette flash]] is used on the screen. When the player's ice corpse shatters, one of the ice chunks will be an {{Class|IceChunkHead}}, carrying the player's [[camera]]. Once the player corpse has shattered, the {{CCMD|D|resurrect}} cheat will no longer work.

'''Note:''' Since the effect originates from ''Hexen'', it does not exist, by default, in ''[[Heretic]]''. The {{Class|Ironlich|iron lich}}'s {{Class|HeadFX1|ice missiles}} and {{Class|HeadFX2|ice shards}} do not inflict ice damage. Of the standard actors, ice damage is used by the {{Class|IceGuy|wendigo}}, its own {{Class|IceGuyFX|ice missiles}} and {{Class|IceGuyFX2|ice shards}}, the {{Class|MagePlayer|mage}}'s {{Class|MWeapFrost|''frost shards'' spell}} with its {{Class|FrostMissile|missile}} and {{Class|IceShard|shards}}.
