Kills the calling actor if it is not already dead, setting its health value to 0 and sending it to its Death state. This has only an effect if the actor has the {{flag|SHOOTABLE}} or {{flag|VULNERABLE}} flag set.

If ''DamageType'' is provided, it determines what type of damage is inflicted upon the actor to kill it. This could be used to determine which [[Custom damage types|Death state]] the monster uses as it dies.

== Examples ==
This {{Class|DoomImp|imp}}'s days are numbered... It will walk around and fire at you normally. But all the while walking on borrowed time, slowly gaining the {{Class|inventory}} "DeathTimer" with every action it takes. When the timer reaches 20, the imp will simulate having a violent heart-attack, then trigger [[A_Die]], forcing it to enter its death state, regardless what its health previously was. For added effect, [[A_Jump]] is used in its see state giving it a small chance to cringe with chest-pain once in a while.

This is the inventory item that the monster uses.
