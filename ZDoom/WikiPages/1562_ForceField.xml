Turns the line into a forcefield that will hurt (8 damage on SKILL_VERY_EASY, 16 on all other) and push the player when activating. It does ''not'' block the player, you have to set the blocking flags on the map. Note that you will have to set it “repeatable” to make the force field persistent and you have to set the proper activation type.

This special can be cleared by the [[A_RemoveForceField]] codepointer. In Strife levels with forcefields, a {{Class|ForceFieldGuard}} actor is always placed in a sector bordering the forcefield linedef so that the explosion of a {{Class|DegninOre}} will destroy it and trigger the removal of the force field effect even if the ore was placed within range but outside of the sector.

== Conversions from linedef types ==
The following Doom map format types can be converted as ForceField:
{| {{prettytable}}
!Type!!Conversion!!Trigger
|-
|{{icon|Strife}} 148:SR Forcefield || ForceField() || Player Use, Repeatable
|}</text>
