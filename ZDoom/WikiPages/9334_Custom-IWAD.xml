A custom IWAD must use the {{c|.iwad}} or {{c|.ipk3}} extension, and must contain an [[IWADINFO]] lump. It can also contain [[DEFBINDS]], [[DEFCVARS]], and [[KEYCONF]] lumps.

If GZDoom is distributed without its {{c|game_support.pk3}} file, it will be unable to detect the regular IWADs and limited to the custom IWAD in the same directory. This can be desirable for distributing stand-alone games without them automatically detecting games installed through {{dw|GOG.com}} or {{dw|Steam}}. This file also contains non-free assets derived from game data (such as fonts) which are unsuitable to commercial distribution, should you wish to sell a custom IWAD you have created. Such a commercial distribution should also omit {{c|brightmaps.pk3}} and {{c|lights.pk3}}.
