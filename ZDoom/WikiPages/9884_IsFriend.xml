{{c|native clearscope bool '''IsFriend'''(Actor ''other'') const}}

== Usage ==
Checks if the calling actor is friendly to the ''other'' actor. This is meant to be run on [[Monster|monsters]] to determine their allegiance.

=== Parameters ===
*{{c|Actor '''other'''}}
:[[Actor pointers|Pointer]] to the actor, whose allegiance should be compared to.

=== Return values ===
The function performs a sequence of checks based on game mode:

:In team deathmatch, the function returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if ANY of the below conditions are met:
:*''other'' is the calling actor's [[IsTeammate|teammate]]
:*The calling actor and ''other'' are allied to different players, but those players are [[IsTeammate|teammates]] (the allied players are determined by the value of the actors' &lt;code&gt;FriendPlayer&lt;/code&gt; fields)
:If none of the conditions are met, returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.

:In other game modes, the function returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if ANY of the below conditions are met:
:*The game mode is NOT [[deathmatch]]
:*Both the calling actor and ''other'' are allied to the same player (determined by the value of their &lt;code&gt;FriendPlayer&lt;/code&gt; fields)
:*The calling actor is not allied to any players (its &lt;code&gt;FriendPlayer&lt;/code&gt; field is {{c|0}})
:*The ''other'' actor is not allied to any players (its &lt;code&gt;FriendPlayer&lt;/code&gt; field is {{c|0}})
:*The calling actor and ''other'' are allied to different players, but those players are [[IsTeammate|teammates]] (the allied players are determined by the value of the actors' &lt;code&gt;FriendPlayer&lt;/code&gt; fields)

If none of the above mentioned conditions were met, the function returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.
