He worked for [[id Software]] from its founding in 1991 until 1996 and was involved in the creation of several milestone games including ''Commander Keen'', ''Wolfenstein 3D'', ''[[Doom|DOOM]]'' and ''Quake'', as well as serving as an executive producer on ''[[Heretic]]'' and ''[[Hexen]]''.

Romero later co-founded Ion Storm Inc. in Dallas, Texas with id co-worker [[Tom Hall]], where he designed and produced ''Daikatana''. The game's critical panning damaged Romero's reputation, who received popular blame for questionable development decisions worsened by his name being hyped in the game's early marketing. Romero left sometime after the release of ''Daikatana'' to co-found Monkeystone Games in July of 2001.

Between 1999 and 2003, Romero was involved with Stevie Case, a prominent female gaming industry figure who beat him in a ''Quake'' [[deathmatch]]. Until their breakup in early 2003, Case was the Chief Operations Officer of Monkeystone Games. In mid October of 2003, Romero joined the team at Midway Games as Project Lead on the next game in the Gauntlet series.
