    <text bytes="1230" sha1="1q6f6hv40o3ctn0b90wv3058hprap8s" xml:space="preserve">'''Spawn numbers''', often referred to as '''SpawnID''' or '''type''', are unique identifiers corresponding to a single actor class for use in script functions and action specials such as [[ThingCount]], [[Thing_Projectile]], [[Thing_Spawn]] and their derived functions. Acceptable values for an actor are included between 1 and 65535: 0 is used for "nothing". They are defined in [[DECORATE]] by the {{Property|SpawnID}} property, and it is also possible to define them in [[MAPINFO]], through a [[spawn number definition]] block. 

Note that new actors need not be assigned a spawn number to spawn them from an ACS script.  Nearly every spawn function that takes a SpawnID has an equivalent function that uses the actor's name directly instead.

Spawn numbers should not be confused with [[DoomEd numbers]]. An actor may have a SpawnID, or a DoomEd num, or both, or neither.

Each game [[ZDoom]] supports uses a separate set of spawn numbers. Each actor with a spawn number has a corresponding defined name in ZDefs.acs, which is indicated in the following lists.

Please select one of the following:
* [[Doom spawn numbers]]
* [[Heretic spawn numbers]]
* [[Hexen spawn numbers]]
* [[Strife spawn numbers]]
