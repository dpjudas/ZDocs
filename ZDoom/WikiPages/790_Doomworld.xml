It is one of the first Doom-related websites in existence, sort of branching off from an earlier site called Functional Entropy. Doomworld was founded by Linguica, Covaro, and Mordeth, on March 14th, 1998.

Doomworld nominated a hundred mods as the "[[Top 100 WADs of All Time]]" for its December 2003 retrospective of Doom's first decade, and since then holds annual "[[Cacowards]]" to honor the most remarkable mods released within the year.
