== Description ==
{{:KZDoom}}The third episode of the [[KZDoom]] series starts you off in a bright outside area with a very blue sky (complete with a couple of white clouds). You then make your well supplied way into the water facility, where you find yourself battling for your life against zombies and demons in order to try and shut off their water, before making your escape.

The theme this time around is still industrial, but seemingly brighter than before, although a lot of the resources and ideas from the previous two installments still feature prominently. Notable gameplay elements include a key being snatched away from you and an exploding room, as well as the usual changes to behavior of the weakest enemies and the shotgun.</text>
