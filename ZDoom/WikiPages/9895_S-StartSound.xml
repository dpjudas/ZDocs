{{c|native static void '''S_StartSound'''(Sound ''sound_id'', int ''channel'', int ''flags'' }}={{c| 0, float ''volume'' }}={{c| 1, float ''attenuation'' }}={{c| ATTN_NORM, float ''pitch'' }}={{c| 0.0, float ''startTime'' }}={{c| 0.0)}}

== Usage ==
Plays a sound, similar to [[A_StartSound]], but not attached to an {{class|Actor|actor}}. This can be called in any [[Object scopes and versions|scope]], and, in contrast to [[A_StartSound]], can be played from UI, for example, from [[ZScript menus|a custom menu]]. However, this sound cannot originate from a point in the world.

=== Parameters ===
The parameters are similar to those used by [[A_StartSound]], but with different names and sometimes different defaults.

*{{c|Sound '''sound_id'''}}
:The sound to play, as defined in [[SNDINFO]].
*{{c|int '''channel'''}}
:The channel to use. In contrast to [[A_StartSound]], this argument is required and has no default value.
{{:StartSound channels}}
*{{c|int '''flags'''}}
{{: StartSound flags}}
*double '''volume'''
:The volume of the sound, which ranges from 0 to 1.0. Default 1.0.
*{{c|double '''attenuation'''}}
:Does nothing, since the sound has no origin point.
*{{c|double '''pitch'''}}
:The sound pitch to play the sound with. Default is 0, which means the engine uses whatever pitch shift (range) that is defined in SNDINFO, if any. For non-zero values anything lower than 1.0 will slow down the sound, while higher values speed it up.
*{{c|double '''startTime'''}}
:Sets how much of the sound to skip when starting. The value can be anywhere between 0 and 1.0, translating to 0% to 100%. Default is 0.

== S_StartSoundAt ==
{{git|a1460e8}}

{{c|native static void '''S_StartSoundAt'''(Vector3 ''pos'', Sound ''sound_id'', int ''channel'', int ''flags'' }}={{c| 0, float ''volume'' }}={{c| 1, float ''attenuation'' }}={{c| ATTN_NORM, float ''pitch'' }}={{c| 0.0, float ''startTime'' }}={{c| 0.0)}}

Functions exactly like ''S_StartSound'', except that the first parameter, ''pos'', allows for making the sound in question play at an arbitrary coordinate instead of being attached to any actor.
