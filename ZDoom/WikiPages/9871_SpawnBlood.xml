{{c|native void '''SpawnBlood''' (Vector3 ''pos1'', double ''dir'', int ''damage'')}}

== Usage ==
Spawns the calling {{class|Actor|actor's}} {{class|Blood|Blood actor}}, as if it was damaged. This function respects the {{property|BloodType}} property.

Blood behavior is still largely hardcoded in GZDoom, so the internals of this function are not exposed to [[ZScript]] at all. The function performs a series of checks, such as checking the {{property|BloodType}}, the game type, applying {{property|BloodColor}} and such.

=== Parameters ===
* {{c|Vector3 '''pos1'''}}
:The position of where the attack came from. This is normally assumed to be the position of the [[Projectile|projectile]] or [[Puff|puff]] actor used by the attack.
* {{c|double '''dir'''}}
:The absolute angle direction of where the attack came from. {{verification}}
* {{c|int '''damage'''}}
:The presumed damage of the attack. &lt;u&gt;This does not deal any actual damage&lt;/u&gt;; this value is only used to determine which state the animation of the spawned blood actor should begin at:
::13 damage or above — begins at the 1st state from the top of Spawn
::9-12 damage — begins at the 2nd state
::8 or less — begins at the 3rd state

== Examples ==
