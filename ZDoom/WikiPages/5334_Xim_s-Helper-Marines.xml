[[Xim's Helper Marines]] WAD is a wad, made by Xim, based off of the Helper Marine item featured in wads such as [[NeoDoom]]. It was made because he was a little put off with the marines all having the same weapons in their hands. And since marine sprites with different weapons were in "high demand" at the time, he thought it'd be a good idea to make the marines have different weapon sprites. Another purpose of the wad is to also be a collection of marines with different weapons, so it can be used a resource wad. He has since discontinued working on this, and future sprites made are being included in the [http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=24210 Marine Skins] pack organized by Ghastly Dragon.
