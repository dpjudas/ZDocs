[[File:HUDOptions.png|thumb|The HUD options menu in [[Blasphemer]].]]
The '''HUD options''' menu regroups all options related to the in-game [[HUD]] and interface, except the [[automap]] which has its own [[automap options|menu]]. Its [[MENUDEF]] name is {{c|HUDOptions}}.
*'''{{LE|Alternative HUD}}'''
:Opens the [[alternate HUD]] submenu.
*'''{{LE|Message Options}}'''
:Opens the [[message options]] submenu.


*'''{{LE|Default Crosshair|crosshair}}'''
:{{c|{{CVAR|R|crosshair}}}}
:Chooses which [[crosshair]] to use, if any. The available options are not declared in [[MENUDEF]] but built from the [[XHAIRS]] lump.
*'''{{LE|Force default crosshair|crosshairforce}}''' (On/Off)
:{{c|{{CVAR|R|crosshairforce}}}}
:Prevents the [[A_SetCrosshair]] [[codepointer]] from affecting the HUD.
*'''{{LE|Grow crosshair when picking up items|crosshairgrow}}''' (On/Off)
:{{c|{{CVAR|R|crosshairgrow}}}}
:If on, the crosshair visually grows a little when items are picked up, provided that the items in question have a {{Property|Inventory.PickupMessage|pickup message}} assigned and the {{Flag|INVENTORY.QUIET|QUIET}} [[actor flags|flag]] cleared.
*'''{{LE|Crosshair color|crosshaircolor}}'''
:{{c|{{CVAR|R|crosshaircolor}}}}
:Chooses the color of the crosshair. This is ignored if "Crosshair shows health" is on.
*'''{{LE|Crosshair shows health|crosshairhealth}}''' (On/Off)
:{{c|{{CVAR|R|crosshairhealth}}}}
:The color of the crosshair depends on the player avatar's current health. Full health is green, above normal is blue, and below full health is yellow, orange or red depending on the severity of the situation.
*'''{{LE|Scale crosshair|crosshairscale}}''' (0&amp;mdash;2.0, by 0.05 increments)
:{{c|{{CVAR|R|crosshairscale}}}}
:If set to any value above zero, the crosshair is scaled according to the resolution so as to occupy always the same proportion of screen space.


*'''{{LE|Display nametags|displaynametags}}''' (None/Items/Weapons/Both)
:{{c|{{CVAR|R|displaynametags}}}}
:Chooses whether the names given to [[artifact|inventory items]], [[weapon]]s, or both with their {{property|Tag}} property is briefly displayed on the screen when they are cycled through with the respective "prev" and "next" functions.
*'''{{LE|Nametag color|nametagcolor}}''' ([[Print]] colors)

*'''{{LE|Stretch Fullscreen HUD|hud_scale}} (On/Off)
:{{c|{{CVAR|R|hud_scale}}}}
:Controls scaling of the fullscreen [[HUD]]. At resolutions of 640&amp;times;400 or above, setting this on will cause the icons to be scaled to approximately the same size they would be at 320&amp;times;200. If off, the icons will always be drawn without any scaling.
*'''{{LE|Use old ouch mug shot formula|st_oldouch}} (On/Off)
:{{c|{{CVAR|R|st_oldouch}}}}
:Setting this to on restores the [[mugshot]]'s {{dw|ouch_face|ouch face bug}}.
