== Description ==
[[Image:AbandonedChapel02.png|thumb|Ite missa est.]]
'''Abandoned Chapel''' is a single-level hub for Hexen. Created by the same author as [[Hordes of Chaos]] and [[Resurrection of Chaos]], it features the same gameplay tendencies towards fierce battles against overwhelming odds in rather cramped areas. The map design is extremely symmetrical and usually involves going through doors on both sides of the chapel to activate switches which, once both triggered, will open a door or allow access to a key in the center. Once the entire chapel is cleared of its aggressive denizens, you have to backtrack all the way around it to open the doors with the emerald locks. Behind lie teleporters that take you to the second zone of the map. Beware! These teleporters can be activated only once each (the "repeatable action" was probably omitted from their [[linedef]]s) and in the second area there is a room where, if you fall, your only exit is through teleporters that bring you back to the chapel, so you will get stuck if you fall twice!</text>
