int '''SpawnDecal''' (int ''tid'', str ''decalname'' [, int ''flags'' [, fixed ''angle'' [, int ''zoffset'' [, int ''distance'']]]])

== Usage ==
Creates a [[decal]] on a wall by tracing a line from the actor with the specified [[TID]] until hitting said wall, on which the decal is then created. If ''tid'' is 0, the tracing is done from the activator of the script.

=== Parameters ===
*''tid'': The TID of the actor.
*''decalname'': The name of the decal to create, as defined in [[DECALDEF]].
*''flags'': These can be combined by using the | character:
**'''SDF_ABSANGLE'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; If present, ''angle'' is an absolute angle. Otherwise, it is relative to the origin actor's angle.
**'''SDF_PERMANENT'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; If present, the decal will stay indefinitely, and will not be removed if the maximum amount of decals present at once in a level is reached (this is controlled by the {{C|{{CVAR|R|cl_maxdecals}}}} [[CVARs|console variable]]).
**'''SDF_FIXED_ZOFF'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; If present, ''zoffset'' is treated as a [[fixed point number|fixed-point value]] rather than an integer.
**'''SDF_FIXED_DISTANCE'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; If present, ''distance'' is treated as a fixed-point value rather than an integer.
:Default is 0.
*''angle'': The direction in which to search for a wall. This is a [[Definitions#Fixed_point_angles|fixed point angle]]. Default is 0.
*''zoffset'': The offset from the middle of the origin actor for the Z height of the decal. Y-flipped decal will have reverse offset. Default is 0.
*''distance'': The maximum distance to search for a wall. Default is 64.

== Return value ==
The return value of the function is the number of decals spawned.
