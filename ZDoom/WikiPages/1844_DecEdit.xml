Decorate Editor support will be at [http://doomguy0505.wiki-site.com/index.php/Decorate_Editor http://doomguy0505.wiki-host.com/index.php/Decorate_Editor]

It has been updated a lot recently and a new Service Pack is available. This is the primary site, I don't want to waste ZDoom's bandwith anymore.

This is (or will be) the successor of the old Decorate Editor. As the name implies, it is written in C#. It is discontinued, sorry.
