Xaser's HELLDOOM is an abandoned ZDoom megawad/total conversion with focus on zany gameplay and brutal action. As originally described, "...this isn't your normal ZDOOM TC. HELLDOOM will have many elements of insanity mixed in, with stuff such as dual auto-shotguns, the Insanity Jetpack, the glass shard launcher, reproducing cyberdemons, demon shitters, Nuke Launchers, Smart Missiles, moving barrels, the HellFire, the Arch-Mastermind, the Great Key Incidentï¿½, and the fabled Exit Gun." Amusingly, the author has since forgotten half of what these descriptions even mean.

The project was abandoned due to lack of interest and too much ambition. The project was slated to have 50 maps, most of which wound up being rips of some sort, and this along with the exhaustive weapon and enemy list doomed the one-man project to a somewhat-early failure. A large chunk of the resources (a few maps in particular) were recycled for use in [[Zen Dynamics]], although the original wad is still somewhat notable for its odd novelty value -- self-replicating cyberdemons and demon-spitting cacodemons are prime examples of its non-serious nature.

The unfinished HELLDOOM was 'released' on July 4, 2008 to the ZDoom Forums in a "failed project" discussion thread and is freely available for download (see [[Xaser%27s_HELLDOOM#External_Links|External Links]]).
