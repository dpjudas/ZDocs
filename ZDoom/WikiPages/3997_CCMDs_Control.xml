    <text bytes="8653" sha1="43vc88743jie71e4lnj6j2stiy2480o" xml:space="preserve">These [[CCMDs|console commands]] are used to directly control the player or HUD.  They can be bound to a key in the controls menu from within the game.

See the [[CCMDs]] article for general information on how to use commands.

==Controls==
Each control has both a + command and a corresponding - command.  Where the + command begins a player action, the - command ends the same action.  For example, pressing the key bound to +forward will start the player moving forward.  Releasing it will execute -forward, which halts the players forward movement.

===Game controls===
* '''{{LE|+altattack|-altattack}}'''
:Use your [[weapon]]'s secondary fire.
* '''{{LE|+attack|-attack}}'''
:Use your [[weapon]]'s primary fire.
* '''{{LE|+back|-back}}'''
:Move backward. (Backpedal)
* '''{{LE|+crouch|-crouch}}'''
:Makes the player [[crouch]] while the key is pressed. Not to be confused with [[#crouch|crouch]], which toggles crouching on and off.
* '''{{LE|+forward|-forward}}'''
:Move (walk or run) forward. 
* '''{{LE|+jump|-jump}}'''
:[[Jump]]. You can also use this command to [[swim]] upwards. If you were [[crouching]], you also automatically uncrouch.
* '''{{LE|+klook|-klook}}'''
:[[Free look|Look]] modifier key.  While active, [[#+forward|+forward]] and [[#+back|+back]] behave like [[#+lookup|+lookup]] and [[#+lookdown|+lookdown]], respectively.
* '''{{LE|+left|-left}}'''
:Turn (rotate) to the left.
* '''{{LE|+lookdown|-lookdown}}'''
:Look down toward the floor.
* '''{{LE|+lookup|-lookup}}'''
:Look up toward the ceiling.
* '''{{LE|+mlook|-mlook}}'''
:Mouselook modifier.  If the {{CVAR|C|freelook}} CVAR is false, you must use the key bound to this while moving your mouse forward or backwards to look up and down.  Otherwise, this does nothing.
* '''{{LE|+movedown|-movedown}}'''
:[[Fly]] or [[swim]] down.
* '''{{LE|+moveleft|-moveleft}}'''
:Move (strafe) to the left.
* '''{{LE|+moveright|-moveright}}'''

* '''{{LE|+moveup|-moveup}}'''
:[[Fly]] or [[swim]] up.

:Go to the [[weapon]]'s "reload" [[state]], provided that the weapon explicitly allows it with [[A_WeaponReady]](WRF_ALLOWRELOAD).
* '''{{LE|+right|-right}}'''

* '''{{LE|+showscores|-showscores}}'''
:While held, displays the [[scoreboard]], which displays player names and frag count during a [[multiplayer]] game.
* '''{{LE|+speed|-speed}}'''
:Normally, this causes your player to move faster (run) while held.  If the {{CVAR|C|cl_run}} CVAR is set, then this reverses roles and causes your player to move more slowly (walk) instead. 
* '''{{LE|+strafe|-strafe}}'''
:Strafe modifier key.  While active, [[#+left|+left]] and [[#+right|+right]] behave like [[#+moveleft|+moveleft]] and [[#+moveright|+moveright]], respectively.
* '''{{LE|+use|-use}}'''
:Try to use or activate something in front of you. 
* '''{{LE|+user1|-user1}}'''
* '''{{LE|+user2|-user2}}'''
