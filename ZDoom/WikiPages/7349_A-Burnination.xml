'''A_Burnination'''

(no parameters)

Plays the sound "world/largefire" on the Voice channel.  Spawns {{Class|PhosphorousFire}} within 31 map units from the originating actor.  If the spot picked has a height outside of actor's {{Property|MaxStepHeight}} then the actor will be spawned in the same location as the caller.  The new actors are always spawned 4 units above the calling actor.

Spawned actors will have {{Flag|DROPPED}} set which will cause this function to be disabled for them. They also have their {{Property|ReactionTime}} set to some value 2-5.  Their x/y velocities will be set to some value 0-7 relative to the calling actor's velocity.

{{Note|This function differs slightly from vanilla Strife. In vanilla the flames are spawned lop-sided since it doesn't use negative offsets.}}

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|PhosphorousFire}} and derived classes.</text>
