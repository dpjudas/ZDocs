== Description ==
{{:Zort}}Finished on 27th March, 1999 by Mike "Cyberdemon" Watson, Zort01 was the first in a series of 9 WADs, seemingly made to introduce the author to ZDoom. This short map showcases many ZDoom features, ranging from [[stealth monster]]s to [[polyobjects]], and despite its small size, it does present a challenge.

Introducing the castle/gothic style used in most Zort wads (with a heavy E4 influence), and also the cricket (an ambient sound), it certainly opens up the series well. It runs on Doom II, MAP01, and uses D_E3M2 for the music, the E4 sky and borrows some sounds from ''Half-Life'' and ''Quake II''.</text>
