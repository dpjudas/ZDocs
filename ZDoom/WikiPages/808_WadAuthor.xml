It was developed by John Williston and is a shareware application.  Development of WadAuthor ceased long ago, with version 1.30 from 2001 being the last version available. 

WadAuthor was available only for a 15 days trial period, after which a license had to be bought to continue using it; however in 2017 the author {{DWForum|t=93968|released WadAuthor as freeware}}, putting a freely-downloadable license file on the new WadAuthor website. The WadAuthor Value Pack, a collection of command-line utilities originally reserved for purchasers of the WA license, was also {{DWForum|t=72557|opened to the general public}} in 2015.
