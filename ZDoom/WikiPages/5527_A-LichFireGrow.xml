'''A_LichFireGrow'''&lt;br /&gt;
(no parameters)

Decreases the calling actor's health by one point and increases its Z position by 9 units. If its health reaches 0, the actor is put in its NoGrow state. This works with [[A_LichAttack]] which creates several of them and gives them varying health counts, so that the fireballs slowly rise to form a steady column.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|HeadFX3}} and derived classes.
