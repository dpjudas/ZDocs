int '''A_GiveToSiblings''' (string ''type'' [, int ''count''])

==Usage==
Adds ''count'' items of type ''type'' to the calling actor's ''siblings''' inventory. This function will not add more items than can be carried.

An actor's ''siblings'' are actors which share a common ''master'' actor with said actor. These ''siblings'' are considered the ''children'' of the ''master''. This relationship is formed when those ''children'' actors are spawned by the ''master'' actor through {{c|[[A_SpawnItemEx]]}} with the SXF_SETMASTER flag passed to the function, or if a child spawns another child with SXF_TRANSFERPOINTERS ''without'' the SXF_SETMASTER flag. This is needed because SXF_SETMASTER will otherwise cause the child of the child to be its child instead of a sibling, as the calling actor with that flag makes it the master instead of its own master.

If ''type'' is an item derived from {{c|{{Class|Health}}}}, then the amount received is the result of multiplying ''count'' by the item's {{Property|Inventory.Amount|amount}}, e.g. if ''type'' is {{c|{{Class|Medikit}}}} and ''count'' is 2, then the amount of health received would be 50 points, not 2.

===Parameters===
*''type'': the item to give. This should be a valid {{Class|Inventory|inventory item}}.
*''count'': the number of samples of this item to give. Default is 0, which is interpreted as 1.

=== Return value ===
The function returns the total number of actors which successfully received the item.
