Eternal Slumber (Working title). From the zdoom forums:

''As you may or may not know, I have created many wads in the past which have scared the pants off people. These include the eerie Ghoul's forest, the jumpy Space station (Alien) and the gimmicky Facefear.wad. However, my next project is going to be even more terrifying than all of them.''

''I can't spill much info, but the map is already complete. The wad is going to be about you, being a ghost hunter of sorts. You've been assigned the job to sleep over at a mansion where people have been mysteriously murdered, and track and destroy the ghost at night. It will start in a morning, so you can look around and explore the mansion you're going to be staying in. And when you're ready to continue, you may change to the night of the hunting at will.''

''However, this isn't going to be your average doom map of running and gunning. And it's not going to be as gimmicky as facefear. Hopefully this dark map will change the gameplay entirely and have you shivering for a long while, since you just know that thing is... somewhere...''

More information as the project continues development.

== Canceled ==

This wad simply turned into [[The Ghoul's Forest 2]]. Sorry for anyone who was waiting for it.</text>
