'''A_MinotaurLook'''&lt;br /&gt;
(no parameters)

If the calling actor is ''not'' a {{Class|MinotaurFriend}} or derived class, calls [[A_Look]] and does nothing else.

Otherwise, does a series of things:
* In deathmatch, targets a nearby (less than 864 map units) player that is not its summoner.
* If it has acquired no target, looks for enemy monsters near its summoner, or near itself.
* If it still hasn't acquired a target, looks for any living monster that is shootable, within 864 map units, and not itself, its summoner, or another monster with the same summoner.
* If it has acquired a target, goes into its See state, otherwise goes into its Roam state.
This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|Minotaur}} and derived classes.
