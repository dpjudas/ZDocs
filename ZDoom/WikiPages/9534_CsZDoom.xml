'''csZDoom''', also known as '''CSZDoom''', is a [[source port]] and fork by [[User:Drfrag|drfrag]]. It is based off [[Zandronum]] 1.3 and it is focused on improving the general codebase through various Quality-of-Life additions. Its name stands for ''Client/Server ZDoom''.

Its main purpose is to be a stable multiplayer platform with broad support for a variety of computer systems. It includes a custom version of [[Doomseeker]] called ''Doomseeker Zero'', which hides regular Zandronum servers, but allows usage of the master server because the network protocol remained unchanged.

==History==
The first release under the csZDoom moniker was 1.4.0, released on July 16, 2021. Being based on Zandronum 1.3, it merges all additions from Zandronum 1.4 alpha and some later versions. It includes Quality-of-Life enchancements like a working sound limiter, support for the double spawn [[deathmatch]] flag so that ongoing survival modes become possible, and other enhancements.

==Features==
* All additions from Zandronum 1.4 alpha
* All features from Zandronum 1.3:
** Support for most [[ZDoom]] (Version 2.3.1+) and [[GZDoom]] features, including the latter's hardware accelerated renderer based on GZDoom 1.1.04 with several additional fixes
** Runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux
* Improved sound limiter 
* New flags for use in multiplayer
