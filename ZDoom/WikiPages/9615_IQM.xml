==Using in GZDoom==
An IQM can be exported from a tool such as {{wp|Noesis (software)}} or {{wp|Blender (software)}}. These models can contain a mesh, or a mesh and animation data. 

Because of how IQM works, an IQM containing '''only''' animation data is unsupported as it needs mesh data to export joints, which are necessary for calculating bone positions. As such the best way to export a series of models that use the same armature would be to export the animation model as an IQM with a single triangle and use it as the animation clip for model index 0, and have the parts that are meant to be drawn as IQMs without any animation data in them as the models.
