{{Special|81|script, map|ACS|Suspend}}

* ''script'': Script to suspend 
* ''map'': Map which contains the script 

==Usage==

Suspends execution of a script until an [[ACS_Execute]] or [[ACS_LockedExecute]] special starts it. If the specified script is not currently running, then it will be immediately suspended the next time it is run.

==Examples==

The following rather long example displays the use of '''ACS_Suspend''' to hold a script for a short time. The first piece of code tells the player a bomb has been activated and displays that it will detonate after a set amount of time.

 script 1 {{SType|Enter}}
 {
 	[[Thing_ChangeTID]](0, 999);
 }
 
 script 17 (int time)
 {
 	[[Print]](s:"A bomb has been triggered!");
 	[[SetFont]]("BIGFONT");
 
 	while (time &gt; 0)
 	{
 		[[HudMessageBold]](i:time--, s:" seconds remain!";
 			{{const|HUDMSG_PLAIN}}, 1, {{const|CR_RED}}, 0.5, 0.95, 1.0);
 		
 		[[Delay]](35);
 	}
 	
 	[[Thing_Damage]](999, 300, 0);
 }

The first script sets every player's [[TID]] to 999. For the second block, the first two lines introduce the scenario for the player. The while loop runs the countdown. Finally, after the countdown, a [[Thing_Damage]] is executed which damages every player 300 points and thus hopefully killing them, to represent the bomb going off.

The following script uses '''ACS_Suspend''':

 script 50 (int hold)
 {
 	[[ACS_Suspend]](17, 0);
 	[[Print]](s:"You bought yourself ", i:hold,
 		s:" seconds!");
 	[[Delay]](35*hold);
 	[[ACS_Execute]](17, 0, 0, 0, 0);
 }

This holds the countdown script for the specified amount of time. It uses '''ACS_Suspend''' to stop it, waits for the amount of time, and then uses '''ACS_Execute''' to resume the script. The reason this works is because '''ACS_Suspend''' and '''ACS_Execute''' always remember where in the script it has been suspended.

If you wanted to stop the script completely, you would use [[ACS_Terminate]].
