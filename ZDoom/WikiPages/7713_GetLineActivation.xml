int '''GetLineActivation''' (int ''lineid'');

==Usage==
Retrieves the line activation flags of the line with the specified [[Magic numbers#Line numbers|line ID]].

===Parameters===
*''lineid'': The ID of the line of which to get the activation flags.

=== Return value ===
The return value of the function is a bitfield where each bit in the result value corresponds to an activation flag value:
*'''SPAC_None''' (0) — No flags.
*'''SPAC_Cross''' (1) — Activated when crossed by player.
*'''SPAC_Use''' (2) — Activated when used by player.
*'''SPAC_MCross''' (4) — Activated when crossed by monster.
*'''SPAC_Impact''' (8) — Activated when hit by projectile.
*'''SPAC_Push''' (16) — Activated when bumped by player.
*'''SPAC_PCross''' (32) — Activated when crossed by projectile.
*'''SPAC_UseThrough''' (64) — Activated when used by player (with pass through).
*'''SPAC_AnyCross''' (128) — Activated by anything crossing it which does not have the {{Flag|TELEPORT}} flag.
*'''SPAC_MUse''' (256) — Activated by monsters using it.
*'''SPAC_MPush''' (512) — Activated by monsters bumping into it.
*'''SPAC_UseBack''' (1024) — The line can be used from the back side.

Since the return value is a bitfield, the individual bits can be checked by using a bitwise AND ({{c|&amp;}}) comparison. More than one flag can be checked by using the bitwise OR ({{!}}) comparison.

== Examples ==
The following script will print a message on the screen if the tagged line can be activated by "using" it:
 Script 1 (int id)
 {
     If([[GetLineActivation]](id) &amp; {{const|SPAC_Use}})
     {
         [[Print]](s:"You can open this door by 'using' it!");
     }
 }


This script will print a message if the tagged line can be activated by "using" it or bumping into it:
 Script 2 (int id)
 {
     If([[GetLineActivation]](id) &amp; ({{const|SPAC_Use}} | {{const|SPAC_Push}}))
     {
         [[Print]](s:"You can open this door by 'using' or bumping into it!");
     }
 }
