== Description ==

Set in a space station floating above a planet colonised by the UAC, Sapphire sends you around a shiny, high tech environment in order to fight back the forces of evil, room by room. The map rounds off with a boss battle with a creature of Eriance's creation (originally seen in [[Demon Eclipse]]), and along the way you can expect a few large battles to keep your adrenaline pumping. This single large map will certainly give your eyes some exercise.
