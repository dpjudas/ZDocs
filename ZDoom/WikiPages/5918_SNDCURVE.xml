[[Heretic]] and [[Hexen]] make use of it, though ZDoom does allow you to use them in other games as well. Such tables are used for any sound that specifies that it uses {{sndinfo|rolloff}} {{c|custom}} in [[SNDINFO]].

Typically this is a square table of bytes; for example Heretic uses a 40x40 table (1600 bytes) and Hexen uses a 45x45 table (2025 bytes). ZDoom, however does not require the lump to be square: the table is actually treated as a one-dimensional array. 

The rolloff value used is the one at an index determined by the position of the sound origin's actual distance between the maximum and minimum distances: the smaller the distance, the lesser the index in the table. A value of 127 means no attenuation; greater means a greater volume and lesser means a lesser volume. Typically, the values scale between 127 at index 0 in the table, and 1 at the very last index.
