'''A_Beacon'''&lt;br&gt;
(''no parameter'')&lt;br&gt;

Attempts to spawn one {{Class|Rebel1}} facing the angle of the calling beacon.  If the spawning creates a useful actor, then the calling actor can no longer be picked up by the player.  A {{Class|TeleportFog}} will also be spawned slightly in front of the rebels.

The rebels have the {{Flag|INCOMBAT}} flag set and will be set in their See state.  In multiplayer the rebels will have the player's translation transferred to them, and in deathmatch the rebels will have their health doubled.

The calling actor's health is decremented by one.  If the actor's health reaches 0 then it is sent to its Death state.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|TeleporterBeacon}} and derived classes.</text>
