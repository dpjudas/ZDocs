 ConversationIDs
 {
   &lt;number&gt; = &lt;class&gt;
 }

Conversation number assignments through this method are overridden by the {{Property|ConversationID|DECORATE one}}. Actors can be assigned multiple conversation numbers, and already-assigned conversation numbers can be mapped to nothing by passing {{c|None}} instead of an actor class name. They can also be mapped to other actors.

==Examples==

In this example, actor ByStander is given conversation number 2851 and actor ShopKeeper is given two conversation numbers; 1205 and 3677.
 ConversationIDs
 {
   2851 = ByStander
   1205 = ShopKeeper
   3677 = ShopKeeper
 }


This example clears conversation numbers 2 and 5, which are used in ''[[Strife]]'' by the {{Class|WeaponSmith|weapon smith}} and {{Class|Medic|medic}}, respectively, and effectively preventing any conversations from being initiated with them.
 ConversationIDs
 {
   2 = None
   5 = None
 }


This one remaps conversation number 4, which is used in ''Strife'' by the {{Class|Armorer|armorer}}, to the weapon smith, and thus making the armorer have the [[DIALOGUE|dialogue]] of the smith. Awkward, but doable nonetheless.
 ConversationIDs
 {
   4 = {{Class|WeaponSmith}}
 }
