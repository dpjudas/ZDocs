== Description ==
'''Foreverhood''' is an independent game developed with the [[ZDoom]] engine, created as an "experimental video project" which presents a surreal environment and a strange story.

The project had one major revision, bumping its version number to 1.1. A more sweeping update was planned, which would have resulted in Foreverhood 2.0, but the project was canceled since and 1.1 remains the last version of the game.

== Reception ==
''Foreverhood'' is a true total conversion and does not use resources from Doom or any other game. It was highly praised, even receiving a [[Cacoward]], for its unique and beautiful visual style, as well as for the huge levels, complex architecture, unique characters and intriguing storyline.
