name '''GetSpecies''' ()

==Usage==

This returns the [[species]] of the calling actor.

===Return value===

The species of the actor, as a name. If the actor does not have its {{property|Species}} property defined, or its set to {{c|'N'one}}, the return value is determined as follows:
*If the calling actor is a [[monster]], the function goes up the inheritance chain of the actor's class, stopping at the first class encountered which has a non-monster parent class. This class's name serves as both the return value and the species of the actor.
*If the calling actor is not a monster, its class's name serves as the return value as well as its species.

==Examples==

Every [[tic]], this {{Class|ZombieMan|former human}} checks if its target is an {{Class|DoomImp|imp}}, and if it is, executes some code.

 class ImpChecker : {{Class|ZombieMan}}
 {
     override void Tick () // See [[ZScript virtual functions]].
     {
         if (target &amp;&amp; target.'''GetSpecies'''() == "{{Class|DoomImp}}")
         {
             // Do something - for example, have an enemy act differently to different targets.
         }
 
         Super.Tick();
     }     
 }
