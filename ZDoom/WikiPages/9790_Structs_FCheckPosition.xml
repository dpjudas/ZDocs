This struct contains information about a position, which can be obtained by functions like [[CheckMove]], [[TryMove]] and [[CheckPosition]].

==Fields==
&lt;/noinclude&gt;*{{c|Actor '''thing'''}}
:Pointer to the actor whose position is stored in this struct.
*{{c|Vector3 '''pos'''}}
:Absolute coordinates of the actor whose position is stored in this struct.
*{{c|Sector '''cursector'''}}
:Pointer to the [[Structs:Sector|sector]] at the current position.
*{{c|double '''floorz'''}}
:Absolute highest floor height at &lt;code&gt;pos&lt;/code&gt;. If the caller is stepping on top of another actor then this is the top of that actor.
*{{c|double '''ceilingz'''}}
:Absolute lowest ceiling height at &lt;code&gt;pos&lt;/code&gt;.
*{{c|double '''dropoffz'''}}
:Absolute highest floor height at &lt;code&gt;pos&lt;/code&gt;.
*{{c|TextureID '''floorpic'''}}
:A [[Structs:TextureID|TextureID]] of the cursector's floor texture.
*{{c|int '''floorterrain'''}}
:[[Structs:TerrainDef|Terrain data]] of cursector's floor.
*{{c|Sector '''floorsector'''}}
:Pointer to the lowest [[Structs:Sector|sector]] at &lt;code&gt;pos&lt;/code&gt;, if portals are involved. Otherwise, same as &lt;code&gt;cursector&lt;/code&gt;.
*{{c|TextureID '''ceilingpic'''}}
:A [[Structs:TextureID|TextureID]] of the cursector's ceiling texture.
*{{c|Sector '''ceilingsector'''}}
:Pointer to the highest [[Structs:Sector|sector]] at &lt;code&gt;pos&lt;/code&gt;, if portals are involved. Otherwise, same as &lt;code&gt;cursector&lt;/code&gt;.
*{{c|bool '''touchmidtex'''}}
:True if actor at &lt;code&gt;pos&lt;/code&gt; is touching a 3D middle texture.
*{{c|bool '''abovemidtex'''}}
:True if actor at &lt;code&gt;pos&lt;/code&gt; is above a 3D middle texture.
*{{c|bool '''floatok'''}}
:If true, the caller can freely move up and down if it floats. This is used to signal the position wasn't fully blocked by a line or actor in [[TryMove]].
*{{c|bool '''FromPMove'''}}
:This is true if this struct was instantiated by &lt;code&gt;P_Move()&lt;/code&gt;. If true, handles non-players overlapping inside of each other by trying to unstick them if possible.
*{{c|line '''ceilingline'''}}
:The [[Structs:Line|line]] the actor collided with if it hit an upper line part. This is set in case a lower line part also blocks, allowing both the floor and ceiling lines to be checked.
*{{c|Actor '''stepthing'''}}
:Another actor the &lt;code&gt;thing&lt;/code&gt; stepped up on, if any.
*{{c|bool '''DoRipping'''}}
:If true, the caller is treated like a {{flag|RIPPER|ripping projectile}}.
*{{c|bool '''portalstep'''}}
:True if the line edge at &lt;code&gt;pos&lt;/code&gt; goes through a ceiling portal by going up a step.
*{{c|int '''portalgroup'''}}
:The index of the portal group the move goes to if &lt;code&gt;portalstep&lt;/code&gt; is true.
*{{c|int '''PushTime'''}}
:Sets any pushed actor's &lt;code&gt;lastPush&lt;/code&gt; field to this value. Used to track which actors were already pushed that move step.&lt;noinclude&gt;

==Methods==
*{{c|void '''ClearLastRipped()'''}}
:Clears information about actors that were already ripped through. Normally an actor is only ripped once per tic.
*{{c|private void '''_Constructor()'''}}
:Internal function, necessary for the struct's setup. Doesn't need to be called manually.
*{{c|private void '''_Destructor()'''}}
:Internal function, necessary for the struct's setup. Doesn't need to be called manually.
