{{c|virtual void '''CollidedWith'''(Actor ''other'', bool ''passive'')}}

== Usage ==
Called after two actors have collided. Similar to {{c|[[CanCollideWith]]}}, but {{c|CanCollideWith}} is called ''before'' collision and, most importantly, doesn't guarantee that the collision will actually happen, in contrast to this function.

Note, this virtual is called back ONLY when a collision actually occurs. If you want to check and abort a potential collision instead, e.g to stop an actor made of multiple smaller actors from colliding with itself, use {{c|[[CanCollideWith]]}} instead.

=== Parameters ===
*{{c|Actor '''other'''}}
:The actor the caller collided with.
*{{c|bool '''passive'''}}
:Used to determine which actor is currently calling the function. If &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, the actor that caused the collision is the current caller; otherwise the caller is the actor that is being collided with.

== Examples ==
