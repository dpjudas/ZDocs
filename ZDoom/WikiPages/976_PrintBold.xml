The function still prints to all player screens, but its default color is different. To rectify that, the {{c|CorrectPrintBold}} [[GameInfo definition|MAPINFO property]] must be set to ''true''.}}

void '''PrintBold'''(''item(s)'');

==Usage==

This is exactly the same as [[Print]], except all players will see the printed text on the screen instead of just the activator of the script. It also uses a different default color. For a detailed description of the syntax, refer to [[Print]].

==Examples==

This command is useful if you want a monster triggered script to print something to the screen. One way a monster can trigger a script is by setting it to their {{c|[[Action special|special]]}} field, so that when they die (or are otherwise [[activation|activated]]), the script is run. Another possibility is to have [[ACS_Execute]] (or one of its variants) in one of the state in a custom actor's [[DECORATE]] code. This script takes one parameter, which is the [[TID]] of the monster which has this script.

 script 99 (int monsterid)
 {
 	[[Thing_SpawnNoFog]](monsterid, {{const|T_REDSKULLKEY}}, 0, 0);
 	[[PrintBold]](s:"The boss has been defeated!");
 }

To clarify: set the monster TID to something unique, and the special to 80 ([[ACS_Execute]]). Set the parameters to (99, 0, monster's TID, 0, 0). When the monster is killed, a message will be reported to all players and the monster will drop a red skull key.
