Ultimate Doom Builder is an actively-maintained fork of [[GZDoom Builder]] which has provided years of bug-fixing and finetuning, as well as introducing UDBScript, allowing advanced users to script tools of their own.  It otherwise meets the same specifications as its predecessors.

Updates are posted on the [https://devbuilds.drdteam.org/ultimatedoombuilder/ DRDTeam Devbuilds repository]
