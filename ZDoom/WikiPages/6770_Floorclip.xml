    <comment>Updated this page a little over 10 years later to mention ZScript's ability to directly change most actor flags, including floorclip.</comment>

    <text bytes="1096" sha1="qi9z6x3pnhjwtf6i1xwxmr8izrh8cgp" xml:space="preserve">The '''floorclip''' is an effect of the floor texture (as defined by the &lt;tt&gt;footclip&lt;/tt&gt; property in a [[TERRAIN]] lump) on actors, cutting off the lower pixels of the sprites. This feature is used to represent [[player]]s and [[monster]]s wading ankle-deep in shallow waters.

Actors need the {{Flag|FLOORCLIP}} flag to have a floorclip. This flag can be [[ZScript actor flags|set and unset directly]] in [[GZDoom]], or changed with the now deprecated [[A_ChangeFlag]] or dedicated [[A_SetFloorClip]] and [[A_UnsetFloorClip]] functions.

Some classes have special functions that manipulate an actor's floorclip to achieve special effects; for example {{Class|SerpentGib1}} increase and decrease it to represent rising up to the surface then sinking back, {{Class|ThrustFloor}} use it to thrust into or out of the floor, and {{Class|WraithBuried}} use it to rise from the ground.

A bug in [[Heretic]]'s floorclip code prevented the {{Class|Minotaur}} from using its floorfire attack when floorclipped; this is fixed but subject to a [[compatibility option]] in [[ZDoom]].
