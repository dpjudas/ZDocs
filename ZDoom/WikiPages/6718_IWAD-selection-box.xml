This dialog serves only to select which IWAD is used as the base game: it is not a full-fledged [[frontend]]. Think of it purely as a game selector, not a mod selector. For loading mods, please refer to [[installation and execution of ZDoom|this article]].

The IWAD selection box can be disabled by setting the &lt;tt&gt;queryiwad&lt;/tt&gt; [[console variable]] to false. This can be done from the [[miscellaneous options]] menu.

The dialog remembers which was the last choice made and will preselect it. If the "Don't ask me this again" box is checked, this choice will be kept for each run of ZDoom, until it is enabled back. This can be done from the menu, by editing the [[configuration file]], by changing the variable through the [[console]] or menu, or by holding the "Shift" key while starting ZDoom.
