== Description ==

[[Image:ph_Quick5Screen.png|right|thumb|230px|Meeting the points on the checklist.]]

The 5th entry in the Quicky# series of maps was made entirely based on the "I'm Still Bored" section on [http://www.doomworld.com/17years/best2.php page 2 of the 2010 Cacowards], which reads as follows:

''Build a small twisted dark computer lab map.''

''Kill a few Mancubi which guard power generator,''

''kill three Arch-Viles,''

''destroy some big computer and''

''kill two Spectres''


''Post your maps in the Cacowards thread. Deadline is Jan 1, 2010.''


As the only entry to this randomly generated challenge, it is quite a small, relatively simple map. The "kill three Arch-Viles" part is notable for packing quite a punch on all difficulties however, and the additional areas created to weave the points on the checklist together make for another map of the expected standard.

Features:

* 1 small-medium sized map
* Some use of ZDoom features for aesthetics and gameplay
* Everything on the checklist

Suitable for single play and 2 player co-op.

Made with:

Doom Builder 2 and XWE
