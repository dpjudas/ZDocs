'''SMMU''', or '''Smack My Marine Up''', is a [[source port]], derived from [[MBF]], developed by Simon Howard. This port is no longer maintained and its official successor is [[Eternity Engine]].

SMMU introduced several features to MBF, most of which are independently available in [[ZDoom]].
* A [[console]], a chasecam and the ability to change the [[FOV]]
* [[Doom Legacy]] [[S_SKIN|player skin]] support
* Colored [[sector]]s, which can be achieved with [[Sector_SetColor]]
* A start map to select skill; which can be imitated with the [[ChangeSkill]] special and the '''noskillmenu''' [[MAPINFO/Episode definition|episode property]]
* "Swirling" floors, similar to what can be obtained with the '''warp''' or '''warp2''' commands in [[ANIMDEFS]]
* An '''A_NailBomb''' codepointer for use in [[DeHackEd]], which can be emulated with [[A_Explode]]
* [[FraggleScript]]
