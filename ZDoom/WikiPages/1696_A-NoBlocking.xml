void '''A_NoBlocking''' [(bool ''drop'')]

void '''A_Fall''' ()

==Usage==
The function does the following:
* It makes the actor visible if it is [[stealth]].
* It makes it non-solid.
* It makes it spawn its [[DIALOGUE|dialogue]]-set and {{Property|DropItem|"regular"}} drop items.
* It clears the dialogue that is assigned to it.

Note that unlike the dialogue-set drop item, which is cleared from the actor after it is spawned (cleared since the actor no longer has a dialogue assigned to it), the regular drop items are not, which means that these items are spawned each time the function is called. Also, if the actor has both dialogue-set and regular drop items, it only spawns the dialogue-set one for that function call. For all subsequent calls, the regular drop items are spawned, instead.

'''A_Fall''' is an alternative name which is Doom's original name for this function.  It functions identically to the default '''A_NoBlocking''' call with default parameters.

Note that in vanilla Doom, item drops are not handled by A_Fall, but instead by {{c|P_KillMobj}} directly. Drops therefore happen immediately when the actor is killed, instead of happening when the actor calls A_Fall like it does in ZDoom.

===Parameters===
*''drop'': Determines whether the actor's [[DropItem]] will be spawned. Default is ''true''.

== Examples ==

This function is typically used in an actor's death state, as can be seen in this [[DECORATE]] code from the Doom 2 {{Class|ChaingunGuy}}.

 Death:
   CPOS H 5
   CPOS I 5 [[A_Scream]]
   CPOS J 5 [[A_NoBlocking]]
   CPOS KLM 5
   CPOS N -1
   stop

'''Note:''' This can be combined with [[A_Scream]] using [[A_ScreamAndUnblock]].</text>
