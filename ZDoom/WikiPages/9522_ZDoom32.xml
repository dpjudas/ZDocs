'''ZDoom32''' is a {{wp|Fork (software development)|fork}} of the [[ZDoom]] [[source port]] by [[User:Drfrag|drfrag]]. It is based off ZDoom 2.8.1 and the last developmental revision of ZDoom after its last official release, version 2.9pre. It focuses on enhancing the latest ZDoom codebase with new unique features, mostly backported from [[LZDoom]] and [[QZDoom]]. It also includes a {{wp|OpenGL}} renderer courtesy of GZDoom 1.9.1 whilst improving the codebase for lower end computers.

==History==
Starting from version 2.8.2 GL, an OpenGL renderer was added, courtesy of GZDoom 1.9.1. Most of the releases focus on improving performance of the software renderer and the OpenGL renderer whilst maintaining compatibility with newer mods, such as [[Brutal Doom]]. It also adds a truecolor renderer from dpJudas.

After two years of inactivity, ZDoom 2.8.6 was released on July 9, 2021. It added a new skill level and an [[IWAD]] selection picker. There are two versions: One with OpenGL and one without, on top of removing SSE2 and assembly optimizations, allowing it to still run on Windows 98.

==Features==
* All features from ZDoom 2.8.1 and GZDoom 1.9.1 ([[ACS]], etc)
* OpenGL 2.0 based renderer
* Truecolor renderer by dpJudas. This is a older renderer than the one that got included in the QZDoom port
* Compiled with Pentium II architecture optimizations
* Sprite and wall distance culling to improve performance
* Culling options for the OpenGL renderer to increase performance
* Low detail modes (from [[ZDoom LE]]) (2x2, 3x2, 4x4)
* Options to switch between {{wp|Direct3D}} and {{wp|DirectDraw}} rendering (Worldsim, backend)
* Modernized keyboard layout
* Optimized executable for {{wp|SSE2}} instructions. This requires a Pentium 4 or Pentium M processor
** Alternative executable without additional SSE2 and assembly instructions and with OpenGL support called {{c|ZDOOM32_N.EXE}}
* Numerous fixes for mods, such as [[Brutal Doom]]
* Various other optimizations from GZDoom, QZDoom, LZDoom, Eternity

==System requirements==
* ZDoom32 requires the following: Pentium II 233, 32 MB RAM, 1 MB {{wp|Super VGA|SVGA}} card and Windows 98. For OpenGL mode a graphics card with GL 2.0 support is required.
