[[ZDoom]] used to use the [[FMOD Ex]] sound system, which features its own [[software synthesizer]] for [[MIDI]] playback and its own [[module replayer]] for [[tracker module]] playback.

The MIDI synthesizer uses DLS [[sound fonts]], defaulting the one that are part of the operating system (for example, gm.dls on Windows systems). The sound font used by the FMOD synthesizer can be changed through the {{c|{{CVAR|O|snd_midipatchset}}}} [[console variable]].

The module replayer supports all modules supported by FMOD Ex. This includes notably IT, MOD, S3M and XM.

==Advantages and drawbacks==
* Not available with the [[OpenAL]] backend.
===MIDI===
* The FMOD midi device is included in FMOD Ex and does not need to be set up or configured specifically, it will generally work "out of the box".
* The DLS format is not widely used in gaming communities, so this synthesizer cannot make use of some of the sound fonts most adapted to the games that ZDoom support.
===Module===
* Format support is less exhaustive than with [[Foo_DUMB]].
