== Description ==

Featuring cutscenes, a compass, heavy use of crouching, fortified positions, a mine field and the Incas also seen in [[BGPA Missions Liberation]], this map takes the usual Doom gameplay and makes sure you keep your head down. With resources and help coming from all over the community, this highly polished and large map will have any player who appreciates something different goggle-eyed with awe. Making use of a lot of GZDoom features, this wad was something of a revolution at the time and a welcome return for fans of [[Marine Assault]].

New weapons, textures, enemies, sounds, music and other features all turn up here to mix in with the different style of gameplay.

This map may cause your computer to slow down during the starting fight due to all of the enemies and the open space. However later in the map this problem will be gone.
