{{DISPLAYTITLE:A_Face}}

'''{{class|Actor}}'''

{{c|void '''A_Face''' (Actor ''faceto'', double ''max_turn'' {{=}} 0, double ''max_pitch'' {{=}} 270, double ''ang_offset'' {{=}} 0, double ''pitch_offset'' {{=}} 0, int ''flags'' {{=}} 0, double ''z_ofs'' {{=}} 0)}}

==Usage==
Makes the calling actor face the actor specified by the ''faceto'' parameter. This is a generalized actor facing function of [[A_FaceTarget]], [[A_FaceTracer]] and [[A_FaceMaster]].

===Parameters===
*{{c|Actor '''faceto'''}}
:A pointer to the actor that the function should make the caller face.
*{{c|double '''max_turn'''}}
:The maximum turn angle; the calling actor cannot turn by more than said angle, however the {{Flag|SHADOW}} flag has no effect in such case. A value of 0 is interpreted as unlimited angle. Default is 0.
*{{c|double '''max_pitch'''}}
:If specified to a value no greater than 180, then the calling actor's pitch is adjusted up to said value to face the actor. A value of 0 is interpreted as unlimited angle; and technically a pitch change will never be greater than 180 degrees. It will also aim at the actor's feet when set to 0. Default is 270, which means its disabled.
*{{c|double '''ang_offset'''}}
:Specifies the amount of degrees to offset the actor's angle by. Positive values turn it left, while negative values turn it right. This is factored in after ''max_turn'' is performed. Due to limitations, distance is not factored in. Default is 0.
*{{c|double '''pitch_offset'''}}
:Adjusts the pitch by this many degrees after ''max_pitch'' has been taken into account. Default is 0.
*{{c|int '''flags'''}}
:Customizes the behavior of the function. Multiple flags can be combined by using the bitwise OR operator (&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) between the constant names:
:*{{c|'*'''FAF_BOTTOM''' — Aim for the bottom of the actor, otherwise known as the raw Z position. Whenever ''max_pitch'' is taken into account, it will aim towards the actor's feet + 32 units above. This flag disables adding that 32 units.
:*{{c|'*'''FAF_MIDDLE''' — Aim for the middle of the actor ({{c|z position + height / 2}}).
:*{{c|'*'''FAF_TOP''' —  Aim for the top of the actor ({{c|z position + height}}).
:Note that all of these flags are taken into account first before anything else.
:Default is 0.
*{{c|double '''z_ofs'''}}
:Offsets the z position distance of the actor to face by this amount. Unlike ''pitch_offset'', this takes into account how far away the actor is at all times. Default is 0.
