== Description ==
{{:Zort}}Presenting quite a happy, green ambience, Zort07 is tough. Released on the 14th December 1999 before its predecessor, Zort07 only has a new teleport sound (RIP, cricket), and makes more limited use of scripting (with less author commentary), but it does use [[deep water]] and a lot of other ZDoom effects, plus it plays quite well &amp;mdash; favorably to previous Zort wads most of the time. However, it does lack some of the less serious atmosphere that previous Zort wads have, though objectively this can be taken in different ways.

The music is from Mark Klem ({{dw|MAP25:_Forgotten_Town_(Memento_Mori_II)|MM2 MAP25}}) and the sky is from ZSignal's sky pack. The map runs on MAP01 of [[Doom II]] like all other Zort wads.
