== About ==
'''Chex Quest 3''' is a 2008 computer game which runs on the [[ZDoom]] engine. It was developed by Charles Jacobi (Chukker), who was the art director and lead artist for {{wp|Digital_Café|Digital Café}} and worked on the original [[Chex Quest]]. Charles credits Mark Quinn a.k.a. "Boingo the Clown" for giving him the motivation to work on Chex Quest again. The completion of this project by the original author, after failed fan-created attempts and a ten-year wait, was a huge surprise and Chex Quest 3 was well-received, earning one of the 2008 [[Cacowards]].

Chex Quest 3 contains slightly updated versions of the maps from Chex Quest (episode 1) and Chex Quest 2 (episode 2), in addition to its new maps. However, it is not compatible with mods created for the original Chex Quest as it modifies several actors, including changes to their editor numbers. The [[:Category:Chex Quest|Chex Quest actors]] described on this wiki are often replaced by unrelated actors, making the use of a Chex Quest 3 configuration, rather than baseline Chex Quest, necessary for [[level editing]].
