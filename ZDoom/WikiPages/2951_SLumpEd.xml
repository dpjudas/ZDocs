SLumpEd is a wxWidgets lump manager/editor being developed by SlayeR. It was the first Doom editor to fully support ZDoom's Zip/Pk3 format.

[[SLADE]] 3 replaced SLumpEd. All SLumpEd features are implemented in SLADE3 since beta 7.

= Main Features =

* Move/delete/add/rename lumps.
* Import to lump / export lump to file.
* Gfx Preview (Sprite/Patch/Flat/PNG).
* Modifiable Gfx offsets (including PNG gfx).
* Syntax hilighting and autocomplete for certain lumps.
* Full zip/pk3 support. Can open and export lumps from zips.
* Ability to open/edit wadfiles within zip/pk3 files.
* [[ACS]] script compiling.
* [[TEXTUREx]] lump editing.
* Conversion between different gfx formats.
