== Description ==
{{:KZDoom}}The demons have decided to take over a castle to try and have a base on Earth, and as Doomguy, you feel it is your sworn duty to load up with a selection of weapons and proceed to wipe them all out. This map has a more open environment than most other [[KZDoom]] series maps, and makes use of different Doom2 textures as bases for editing, due to the rather natural theme of most of the map, mixed with the castle environment that you will be heading into.

As usual, you are kitted out just as the level starts, and then dropped (literally this time) into the action. Tricks this time are perhaps more creative than before and the new environment allows for some different fighting, although tight quarters battles do feature in areas.</text>
