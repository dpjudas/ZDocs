==Usage==
Triggers the discovery of a secret by the calling actor, as if the player entered a [[sector]] or picked up an item which is marked as a secret. When called, the number of currently discovered secrets on the map goes up by one. However, the total number of secrets remains unchanged.

===Parameters===
*''printmsg'': if ''true'', enables the display of the secret discovery message. The message is printed if the {{c|cl_showsecretmessage}} [[CVARs|console variable]] is set to ''true'' and the calling actor is a player, or a non-player but the player is looking out through its eyes. Default is ''true''.
*''playsound'': if ''true'', enables the playing of the secret discovery sound, which is {{c|"misc/secret"}}. The sound is played if the calling actor is a player, or a non-player but the player is looking out through its eyes. Default is ''true''.
