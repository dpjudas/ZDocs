 SpawnNums
 {
   &lt;number&gt; = &lt;class&gt;
 }

Spawn number assignments through this method are overridden by the {{Property|SpawnID|DECORATE one}}. Actors can be assigned multiple spawn numbers, and already-assigned spawn numbers can be mapped to nothing by passing {{c|None}} instead of an actor class name. They can also be mapped to other actors.

==Examples==

In this example, actor BerserkImp is given spawn number 3001 and actor GoldenMug is given two spawn numbers; 4489 and 22594.
 SpawnNums
 {
   3001 = BerserkImp
   4489 = GoldenMug
   22594 = GoldenMug
 }


This example clears spawn numbers 3 and 113, which are used in ''[[Doom]]'' by the {{Class|HellKnight|hell knight}} and {{Class|BaronOfHell|baron of hell}}, respectively, and effectively preventing any of those monsters from being spawned via spawn functions or specials which take spawn numbers to identify the actor class to spawn, such as [[Thing_Spawn]]. This is done by mapping their spawn numbers to {{c|None}}.
 SpawnNums
 {
   3 = None
   113 = None
 }


This one remaps spawn numbers 25 and 132, which are used in ''Doom'' by the {{Class|Soulsphere|soul sphere}} and {{Class|Megasphere|megasphere}}, respectively, to the {{Class|Revenant|revenant}} and {{Class|Archvile|archvile}}.
 SpawnNums
 {
   25 = {{Class|Revenant}}
   132 = {{Class|Archvile}}
 }
