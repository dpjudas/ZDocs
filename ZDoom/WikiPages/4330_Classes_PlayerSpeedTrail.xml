The trail of after-images left by a [[:Category:Player|player]] using the [[Classes:ArtiSpeedBoots|boots of speed]] or equivalent power. They gradually fade out in seven tics, becoming more and more translucent every tic, and are destroyed at the eighth tic. The actor can only be seen in chasecam, by other players and cameras but never by creator's point of view.
