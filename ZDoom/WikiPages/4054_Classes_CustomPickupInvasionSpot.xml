&lt;u&gt;CustomPickupInvasionSpot&lt;/u&gt; is the base class for custom Invasion pickups. By inheriting from it you can create spawn spots for new [[DECORATE]] powerups, ammo, weapons and other inventory items.


==== Using in [[DECORATE]] ====
The &lt;u&gt;CustomPickupInvasionSpot&lt;/u&gt; base class only needs one property for it to work, which is dropitem.

:*'''dropitem''' ''class''
::The class of the pickup you want the Invasion spot to spawn. Can be used more than once to spawn more than one pickup picked at random.

===== Examples: =====
Example of a single custom invasion spot:

 actor UltrasphereSpot : CustomPickupInvasionSpot 12345
 {
 dropitem "UltraSphere"
 }
Example of a random custom invasion spot:

 actor NewSpheresSpot : CustomPickupInvasionSpot 123456
 {
 dropitem "UltraSphere"
 dropitem "BlackSphere"
 }

==== Using in a map editor ====
CustomPickupInvasionSpot, like all invasion spots, take 5 special arguments.

:*'''Start Spawn Number'''
::The number of things spawned in the first wave they appear.
:*'''Spawn Delay'''
::The spawn delay in seconds between spawning things.
:*'''Round Spawn Delay'''
::The delay in seconds from the start of the wave before spawning things.
:*'''First Appear Wave'''
::The wave that the things start spawning in.
:*'''Max Spawn'''
::The maximum number of pickups that can be spawned by this spot.

=== Invasion Formula ===
On any given wave, the number of pickups that will be spawned is determined by this formula:
: '''(Difficulty Modifier ^ Wave Age) * Starting Amount'''
:: The difficulty modifier is 2 for ''I'm too young to die'' and ''Hey, not too rough'', 1.75 for ''Hurt me plenty'', and 1.6225 for ''Ultra-Violence'' and ''Nightmare!''.
:: Wave age is determined by using the current wave and substracting First Appear Wave (with a minimum of 0).
:: The starting amount is the value given in the first argument, Start Spawn Number.
The given value is then limited to Max Spawn Number.
