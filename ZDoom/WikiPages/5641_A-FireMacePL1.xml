'''A_FireMacePL1'''&lt;br&gt;
(''no parameter'')&lt;br&gt;

Has two different outcomes, chosen at random.
* Main mode (about 89% chance): adjusts the weapon sprite by up to one unit left or right, and up to three units down. Fires a {{Class|MaceFX1}} with a random angle of up to 4.21875° left or right. The ball's &lt;tt&gt;special1&lt;/tt&gt; field is set to 16.
* Secondary mode (about 11% chance): shoots a {{Class|MaceFX2}} at a height of 28 units, and makes the ball play the sound "weapons/maceshoot" on its BODY channel. The ball's initial vertical velocity is of 2 points higher than the normal for the player's pitch, and its horizontal velocities are independent of said pitch.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|Mace}} and derived classes.
