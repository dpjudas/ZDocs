''ZZDoom''' is a {{wp|Fork (software development)|fork}} of the [[ZDoom]] [[source port]] by [[User:Drfrag|drfrag]]. It is based off the last developmental revision of ZDoom after its last official release, version 2.9pre and GZDoom 2.4.0.
It focuses on enhancing the latest ZDoom codebase with backported features from [[GZDoom]] and modern standards. 

==History==
ZZDoom was released as a response to provide a stable build of the latest developmental revision of ZDoom called 2.9pre. drfrag sought out to provide a enhanced experience by backporting various pieces of code altogether from various forks, resulting in a stable release that deviates significantly from the ZDoom 2.8.1 experience. Alongside various bug fixes, support for new standards like [[ZScript]], [[DEHEXTRA]] and {{dw|UMAPINFO}} was added. The first and only release was on December 25, 2021 as version 2.9.0.
