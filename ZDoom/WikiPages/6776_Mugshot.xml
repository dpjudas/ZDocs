The '''mugshot''' is a component of the [[Doom]] [[status bar]], and can be used in [[SBARINFO]]. Note, even when creating HUDs in [[ZScript]], the mugshots are still defined in SBARINFO.

The mugshot serves several purposes:
* It provides a visual representation of the overall {{Property|Health|health}} of the [[player]] (redundant with the health indicator and possibly the [[crosshair]]).
* It also gives directional indication for sources of damage, by "looking" in the direction of the damage source.
* It reveals the use of the god mode [[cheat]].
* It also reacts to other events, such as grinning when picking up a new [[weapon]] or grimacing when holding fire for a while.

Of particular note is the {{dw|ouch_face|ouch face bug}} which [[ZDoom]] fixed but which can be turned back on in the [[HUD options]] menu. A good reason to do so is if having a hint for the direction of the damage is found more important than having a hint for the intensity of said damage, since the standard ouch face always looks straight ahead.
