'''A_WhirlwindSeek'''&lt;br /&gt;
(no parameters)

Decreases the calling actor's health by three points, if it becomes lesser than zero, sets its speed to 0 on all three axes, clears its MISSILE flag, and puts it in its Death state. Then do nothing else.

Otherwise, decreases the calling actor's &lt;tt&gt;special2&lt;/tt&gt; field by three points. If it becomes lesser than zero, sets it back to a random value between 58 and 90, and plays the sound "ironlich/attack3" on the BODY channel. If the calling actor's tracer doesn't have the SHADOW flag (which is given by {{Class|PowerInvisibility}} items), it also calls [[A_SeekerMissile]] with a threshold of 10° and a maximum angle of 30°.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|Whirlwind}} and derived classes.
