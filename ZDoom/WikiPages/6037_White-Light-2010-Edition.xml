== Description ==
Due to the cancellation of White Light 2, Phobus found himself with multiple custom created resources with no home and little prospect of being released. He made a special edition of [[White Light]] to both enhance that critically unsuccessful project and to make use of these resources. This version features cleaned up and altered scripts, an extra 9 monsters, a new weapon (complete with alternate fire) and slightly improved aesthetics. The main change is the gameplay, which is considerably more varied and interesting as a result.

Features:

* 1 arena map
* A MIDI track made by farlowj
* 10 DECORATE monsters
* 1 DECORATE weapon (sprites used with permission from Neoworm)
* New Textures and Flats
* Heavy usage of ZDoom features, including ACS and DECORATE
* An exceedingly bright environment, plus a real challenge

Suitable for single play, but co-op starts are included.

Made with:

Doom Builder, MSPaint and XWE
