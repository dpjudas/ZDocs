'''A_InquisitorDecide'''

(no parameters)

Calls [[A_FaceTarget]]. If the calling actor's reaction time is 0, has line of sight to its target, and this target is within 264 map units, then the calling actor is put in its Grenade state. However, if the target is not at the same altitude as the calling actor, and there is a clearance of at least 54 map units between the ceiling and the calling actor's head, then it is put in the Jump state instead.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|Inquisitor}} and derived classes.
