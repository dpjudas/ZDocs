From December 2004 to February 2005, Randy worked on adding the software rendering parts of Polymost to [[ZDoom]]. After remaining a decade in unfinished form, it was removed in 2014 ({{cs|bbc3b69}}), so ZDoom 2.7.1 is the last released version of ZDoom containing this feature. GZDoom 3.0 added a new software-based 3-point renderer (without the [[Y-shearing]] when looking up and down), [[SoftPoly]].

The Polymost renderer in ZDoom could only render world geometry, either in wireframe or in solid colors. It could be tested by setting {{c|r_polymost}} to 1 (wireframe), 2 (solid colors with wireframe) or 3 (solid colors without wireframe) in the console. 

Note that:
#It was overlaid on the software renderer output. In wireframe mode, it was still playable; but in solid colors mode, the polygons masked the normal view entirely, rendering actors invisible.
#Since it was part of the software renderer, if you use the [[OpenGL]] renderer from [[GZDoom]] or [[Skulltag]], this would have had no effect.

The two screenshots illustrate the difference between Doom's horizontal projection and the true 3D perspective of polymost.

[[Image:Polymost03.png|right|thumb|230px|Global tilt angle.]]One other console variable affected the polymost rendering: {{c|gtang}}. It corresponded to the global tilt angle, in {{wp|radian|radians}}. Positive values tilted the angle clockwise, negative values tilted it counter-clockwise. With an approximation of Ï€ (positive or negative), the projection was upside-down.
