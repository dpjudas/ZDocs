==Usage==
Drops an item to the ground by the calling actor.

To be dropped, the item needs to have an owner. This owner does not necessarily need to be the calling actor itself. Items which have the {{Flag|INVENTORY.UNDROPPABLE}} or {{Flag|INVENTORY.UNTOSSABLE}} flags set cannot be dropped, as well as items which lack the Spawn [[Actor states|state]]. The number of samples the dropped item could contain cannot be more than what the owner has in their inventory of the item.
{{note|what is explained above is the default behavior, a behavior which can be altered through the [[ZScript virtual functions|virtual function]] {{c|[[CreateTossable]]}}.}}
A dropped item will have its {{Flag|NOGRAVITY}} flag explicitly cleared, and will no longer count towards the map's statistics.

===Parameters===
*''item'': the item to drop. This is a pointer to the item.
*''amt'': the number of samples the dropped item contains. Default is -1, which is considered as one sample.

===Return value===
The function returns a pointer to the item if it was dropped successfully, otherwise it returns {{c|null}}.

==Examples==
The killer of this {{Class|archvile}} drops an {{Class|Cell|energy cell}} that is worth 20 ammo from their inventory.
 class ExArchvile : {{Class|Archvile}}
 {
     override void [[Die]] (Actor source, Actor inflictor, int dmgflags, Name MeansOfDeath)
     {
         Super.Die(source, inflictor, dmgflags, MeansOfDeath);
 
         if (source)
         {
             {{Class|Inventory}} drop = source.[[FindInventory]]("{{Class|Cell}}");
 
             if (drop)
             {
                 source.'''DropInventory'''(drop, 20);
             }
         }
     }
 }
