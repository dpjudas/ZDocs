It was added in May 2006, so it was first introduced officially in ZDoom 2.1.0. Crouching can be selectively enabled or disabled through [[MAPINFO]] [[map definition]]s and through the [[gameplay options]] menu. The [[console variables]] {{CVAR|C|sv_allowcrouch}} and {{CVAR|C|sv_nocrouch}} govern whether crouching is possible, possible if not disallowed by the map, or impossible. ZDoom projects released before 2006 are understood to have been built without crouching in mind.

If a [[player class]] is not provided crouch [[sprite]]s with the {{Property|Player.CrouchSprite}}, the ZDoom uses the normal sprite vertically shrunk. This is not an ideal solution, but it has the merit of actually showing the player is crouching. A crouched [[player]]'s height is equal to half its normal height. [[Monster]]s cannot crouch.
