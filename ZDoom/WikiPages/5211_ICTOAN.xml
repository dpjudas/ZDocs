== Description ==

A map made for the sole purpose of proving that Xaser can indeed make a serious map (before the release of [[Zen Dynamics]]), this short map sends the player into a space ship in order to clear it of the enemy presence and claim it back for humanity. Featuring a simple plot, tight action and straight forward playability - Xaser achieved his aim well enough to make this a popular wad with those who have played it.

Featuring music that inspired the name and a few extra tracks by Xaser, the larger focus was on the level itself during development, and it shows. Parts of this were used in the now dead ZDoom Community Map Project Take #2.</text>
