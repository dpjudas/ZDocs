Each pixel is described as a single bit, on or off, and so each line is described as a single byte; therefore the byte size corresponds to the total number of lines. A single character's eight is 1/256 that amount. A character's description is the ''character height'' bytes found at the ''character number'' &amp;times; ''character height'' offset in the file. There is no header or other form of meta-information.

This format is the one used by {{wp|System_console|system consoles}}, {{wp|Terminal_emulator|terminal emulators}} and similar {{wp|Command-line_interface|command line interfaces}}.

[[ZDoom]] uses it only for [[ANSI]] screen emulation and uses the one described in the file &lt;tt&gt;vga-rom-font.16&lt;/tt&gt; contained in zdoom.pk3. This font format cannot be used for in-game fonts.
