They must be derived from {{Class|PlayerPawn}}. Each supported [[IWAD|game]] features its own player class, and [[Hexen]] as well as some mods such as [[TUTNT]] offer you a choice of player classes when starting a new game.

Because the choice of player class is made by the player, rather than by the map, it is not possible to use the "replaces" keyword to change the class list available when starting a game. [[Creating new player classes]] therefore cannot be done purely with [[DECORATE]] if the classes are to be made available in the [[class selection menu]].
