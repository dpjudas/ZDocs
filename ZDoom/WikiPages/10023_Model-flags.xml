! [[MODELDEF]] flag name
! Related [[ZScript]] constant
! Description
|-
| {{c|PITCHFROMMOMENTUM}}
| {{c|MDL_PITCHFROMMOMENTUM}}
| Adjusts the model's pitch to match the momentum of the actor. Useful for projectiles&lt;br /&gt;that ''don't'' call [[A_FaceMovementDirection]] to adjust their actual pitch in flight.
|-
| {{c|IGNORETRANSLATION}}
| {{c|MDL_IGNORETRANSLATION}}
| Ignores the actor's [[Translation|color translation]].
|-
| {{c|INTERPOLATEDOUBLEDFRAMES}}
| {{c|MDL_INTERPOLATEDOUBLEDFRAMES}}
| Smoothes model interpolation for actors that use the same frame twice in a row&lt;br /&gt;(for example, most of the standard Doom monsters do this in their see state).
|-
| {{c|ROTATING}}
| {{c|MDL_ROTATING}}
| Makes the model rotate continuously. Useful for pickup models a la Quake.&lt;br /&gt;Related properties must be defined AFTER this flag in [[MODELDEF]].
|-
| {{c|NOINTERPOLATION}}
| {{c|MDL_NOINTERPOLATION}}
| Forces uninterpolated animation.
|-
| {{c|USEACTORPITCH}}
| {{c|MDL_USEACTORPITCH}}
| Model's pitch adjusts to match actor's pitch.
|-
| {{c|USEACTORROLL}}
| {{c|MDL_USEACTORROLL}}
| Model's roll adjusts to match actor's roll.
|-
| {{c|INHERITACTORPITCH}} {{deprecated}}
| ''none''
| Model's pitch adjusts to match the actor's pitch, deprecated because of the unintended pitch inversion and bad name choice
|-
| {{c|INHERITACTORROLL}} {{deprecated}}
| ''none''
| Model's roll, adjusts to match actor's roll. Same as {{c|USEACTORPITCH}}, deprecated because of bad name choice.
|-
| {{c|DONTCULLBACKFACES}}
| {{c|MDL_DONTCULLBACKFACES}}
| Forcefully disables backface culling.
|-
| {{c|FORCECULLBACKFACES}}
| {{c|MDL_FORCECULLBACKFACES}}
| Forcefully enables backface culling.
|-
| {{c|USEROTATIONCENTER}}
| {{c|MDL_USEROTATIONCENTER}}
| Makes {{c|Rotation-Center}} affect actor angles (the property must be set AFTER this flag to work).&lt;br /&gt;Useless unless any of the actor rotation flags are also used.
|-
| {{c|NOPERPIXELLIGHTING}}
| {{c|MDL_NOPERPIXELLIGHTING}}
| Disables per-pixel lighting on the model.
|-
| {{c|SCALEWEAPONFOV}}
| {{c|MDL_SCALEWEAPONFOV}}
| Scales the weapon's model along with the user's [[FOV]] to reduce distortion.
|-
| {{c|MODELSAREATTACHMENTS}}
| {{c|MDL_MODELSAREATTACHMENTS}}
| If the actor uses an [[IQM]] model, another model can be attached to it, provided the other model&lt;br /&gt;uses the same armature. For example, this can be used to hot-swap the weapon model in a&lt;br /&gt;character's hands. Model and index 0 is considered the base model.&lt;br /&gt;Attached models cannot have separate animations; they will be animated alongside the armature&lt;br /&gt;of the base model. Each model needs to have the same exact armature or unwanted behavior may occur.&lt;br /&gt;Having this flag defined takes priority over the Animation property.
|-
| {{c|CORRECTPIXELSTRETCH}}
| {{c|MDL_CORRECTPIXELSTRETCH}}
| By default, models stretch when their pitch or roll changes, in a way that matches [[aspect ratio correction]].&lt;br /&gt;This flag disables that behavior so the model always retains the same size without any distortion.&lt;br /&gt;Note: Although technically a bug, the stretching can nevertheless be useful, for example, to ensure that a&lt;br /&gt;beam-shaped model retains the same length in map units regardless of orientation.&lt;br /&gt;
