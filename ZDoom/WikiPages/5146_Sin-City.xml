== Description ==

The first in a series of three wads, Sin City is a small map made up of largely brown textures. Ed Cripps cites {{dw|The Spirit World}} as inspiration for this short, violent and well designed single player adventure. [[ZDoom]] features are not used quite as often as in the later two WADs, but it does still include music by Skinny Puppy, new sounds and graphics (a [[TITLEPIC]], amongst other things).

Aside from in the gameplay, this map does not bear much resemblance to its sequels.
