Skill: The skill that the game will be changed to. The default skill levels are:
* 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Very Easy
* 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Easy
* 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Normal
* 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Hard
* 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Nightmare!

==Usage==

Changes the current skill of the game. The skill change will take affect at the next map change. Instead of numbers (0&amp;mdash;4), you can also use the following (defined in '''zdefs.acs'''):

* '''SKILL_VERY_EASY'''
* '''SKILL_EASY'''
* '''SKILL_NORMAL'''
* '''SKILL_HARD'''
* '''SKILL_VERY_HARD'''

Using these will greatly increase code readability. Note, however, that ZDoom can support up to 16 skill levels, though only [[UDMF]] maps can provide skill filters for skills above 4.

==Examples==

This is a simple example script which ends the level, adjusting the skill according to a very primitive inspection of the player's final state. The script works just like an [[Exit_Normal]] special.

 script 100 (int pos)
 {
 	int health = [[GetActorProperty]](0, APROP_HEALTH);
 	
 	if (health &lt; 25 &amp;&amp; [[GameSkill]]() &gt; SKILL_VERY_EASY)
 		ChangeSkill(GameSkill() - 1);
 	
 	if (health &gt; 100 &amp;&amp; GameSkill() &lt; SKILL_HARD)
 		ChangeSkill(GameSkill() + 1);
 	
 	Exit_Normal(pos);	
 }

First the health of the player is found. Then, if they are particularly low on health, and it is possible to reduce the skill, the skill is dropped a level. On the other hand, if they are doing very well, the skill is increased. Finally the level is exited as normal.
