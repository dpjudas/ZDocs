'''A_HideDecepticon'''

(no parameters)

Alerts the calling actor and puts it in its See state, which due to inheritance, in the case of the {{Class|AcolyteToBe}}, changes its sprite to a finished Acolyte and makes it begin to attack the player. This codepointer also closes any door tagged 999.

The function's name is a contrived little joke about the calling actor transforming into a bad guy, and the Decepticons being the evil Transformers, and this function being used to hide them in the map where these actors are used. Because the actual source code for Strife was never released and is believed to be lost, the original name of this function is unknown.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|AcolyteToBe}} and actors inheriting from it.
