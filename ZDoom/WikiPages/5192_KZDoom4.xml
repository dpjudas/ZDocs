== Description ==
{{:KZDoom}}Given supplies and told to get ready and watch your step, you are thrown into a wood and brick style level. Featuring odd tricks with imps, explosions and an [[earthquake]], this level forgets the conventions in gameplay from previous installments in the [[KZDoom]] series in order to provide you with a more open play area.

Of course, this does mean that with the more open area, the tricks and traps will change also, and that there is more space for bigger enemies. It forgoes new sounds, but otherwise keeps to the same resource principles as before.</text>
