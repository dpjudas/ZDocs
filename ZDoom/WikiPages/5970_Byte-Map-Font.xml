    <text bytes="2414" sha1="h0720n71uyvtavdbnyc7ga4zymifd55" xml:space="preserve">A '''Byte Map Font''', or '''BMF''', contains an arbitrary amount of paletted characters.

It is of this form:
{| {{prettytable}}
!Offset !! Length !! Name !! Content
|-
|0x0000 || 4 || Identifier || 0x1AD5E6E1
|-
|0x0004 || 1 || Version || Normally 0x11
|-
|0x0005 || 1 || Line height || Unsigned value
|-
|0x0006 || 1 || Size over the base line || Signed value
|-
|0x0007 || 1 || Size under the base line || Signed value
|-
|0x0008 || 1 || Space after each character, in addition to each character's own shift || Signed value
|-
|0x0009 || 1 || Inner size (?) || Signed value
|-
|0x000A || 1 || Count of used colors (not the same as palette size) || Unsigned value
|-
|0x000B || 1 || Highest used color index || Unsigned value
|-
|0x000C || 4 || Reserved values || Should be 0x00000000
|-
|0x0010 || 1 || Number of RGB entries in the palette || Unsigned value
|-
|0x0011 || x*3 || Palette || A series of 6-bit RGB values, starting from palette index 1 (index 0 is transparent and not described).
|}
After the palette comes an information string about the font:
{| {{prettytable}}
!Offset !! Length !! Name !! Content
|-
|0x0000 || 1 || Size || Unsigned value
|-
|0x0001 || x || Info || ASCII characters
|}
After the string comes a two-byte, little-endian unsigned value for the amount of characters. Then comes the character data:
{| {{prettytable}}
!Offset !! Length !! Name !! Content
|-
|0x0000 || 1 || Which character || ASCII character
|-
|0x0001 || 1 || Width || Unsigned value, size of the character image
|-
|0x0002 || 1 || Height || Unsigned value, size of the character image
|-
|0x0003 || 1 || X-offset || Signed value, offset of the character image relative to the cursor
|-
|0x0004 || 1 || Y-offset || Signed value, offset of the character image relative to the cursor
|-
|0x0005 || 1 || Shift || Horizontal cursor shift after drawing the character (used instead of width) in addition to the global font value of space added after each character
|-
|0x0001 || x || Info || Character image as raw pixels in row-major format
|}
Characters are listed one after the other until the end of the file. Note that some characters may have a null image (0 width and/or 0 height); spaces are likely to have no image and instead be defined only by the shift value.
