UAAF: Hell Strikes (or UAAF: Hell Unleashed) is a current WIP mod for ZDoom that recreates the history of the Doom Alpha and the {{Dw|Doom Bible}} with a high detailed tech-hell maps style.

==Overview==

This mod takes maps of the Alpha0.4 and the Alpha0.5 maps, but completed, because the alpha maps created by ID Software are not completed at all, some new areas added, but it has the classic feel on it, it will contain a lot of new textures, you take place on {{Dw|Tei Tenga}}.

You are one of the marines, and you must go through the levels and find the Main core, the extracting of the "Fire Dust", the Communication System and more.

===Weapons===
The mod will contain a lot, or all the weapons that the {{Dw|Doom Bible}} talks about, as the '''Bayonet:''' replacing the fist, the '''{{class|Chainsaw}}:''' , the '''Assault Rifle:''' replacing the pistol, the '''Shotgun''', the '''Super Shotgun''', the '''Chaingun''', the '''Rocket Launcher''' and the {{Dw|Unmaker}}.

===Development===
There is only one person working on this project, the leader and creator: Ledillman working on this, Mapping, Design, Detail, Decorate scripts, Mapping scripts, Spriting.
The mod maybe will see a demo on 2013.</text>
