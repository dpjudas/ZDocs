    <text bytes="1055" sha1="m4sxis11gzzj3jpsinln2aq6gq4lh3g" xml:space="preserve">ZDoom can read content from the following archive formats:
* [[WAD]]: Doom's native format; it is sequential and does not offer compression
* GRP: [[Build]]'s native format
* RFF: [[Blood]]'s native format
* PAK: Quake's native format
* [[ZIP]]/PK3: Contrarily to most implementations, ZDoom fully implements the ZIP standard and is able to open zipped archives that many utilities do not
* 7z/PK7: One of the best all-around compressed archive format
* Directory: Technically not an archive format, nevertheless ZDoom is able to load the entire content of a directory
* Single file: Also technically not an archive format, nevertheless a single lump can be loaded
* Embedded wad: a .wad file contained within a non-wad archive will be recursively loaded

Important: maps are made of a series of lumps which cannot be separated. For this reason, maps must remain in wad files; though these wad files can in turn be embedded in a different archive.
