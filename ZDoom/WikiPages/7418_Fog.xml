There is a global fade color set in [[MAPINFO]] with the {{c|fade}} property, but individual [[sector]]s can vary. First, sectors with a [[sky]] ceiling will use the {{c|outsidefog}} color defined, if any; as will sectors of [[sector special|type]] 87:Sector_Outside. Secondly, any sector can have its own colored fog set in one of the following three ways:
* In [[UDMF]] only: with the {{c|fadecolor}} sector property.
* With a {{Class|FadeSetter}} thing placed in the sector.
* With the [[Sector_SetFade]] special, which can be used dynamically in a script.

You can use the {{CCMD|D|testfade}} console command to test a color from within the game.

Fullbright sprites do not appear full bright in fogged sectors.

There is more difference between fogless sectors (fade #000000) and foggy sectors than between the two extremes of dark fog (fade #000001 vs. fade #FFFFFF).

==OpenGL==
Some additional options are available to the [[OpenGL]] renderer.

Since a fade is sometimes used to change the ambiance of a level rather than to simulate fog, the [[console variable]] {{CVAR|R|gl_spritebrightfog}} can be used to force bright sprites to remain bright in fog.

In [[MAPINFO options for GZDoom's GL renderer|MAPINFO]], the fog density can be modified, for both outside and inside fog. Fog can also be applied to the [[sky]].
