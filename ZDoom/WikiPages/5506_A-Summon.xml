'''A_Summon'''&lt;br /&gt;
(no parameters)

Spawns a {{Class|MinotaurFriend}}.

If the summoned monster cannot be successfully spawned in its location, or if the calling actor does not have a valid &lt;tt&gt;tracer&lt;/tt&gt;, it is instantly removed and a new {{Class|ArtiDarkServant}} is spawned in its place.

Otherwise, the summoned monster has its &lt;tt&gt;StartTime&lt;/tt&gt; field set to the current tic, its &lt;tt&gt;tracer&lt;/tt&gt; field set to the summoner (unless the summoner is dead), the summoner (if alive) is given a {{Class|PowerMinotaur}}, the summoned monster's friendliness setting is set up, a {{Class|MinotaurSmoke}} is spawned and the summoned monster is made to play its active sound on the VOICE channel.

This codepointer assumes that the summoner is the actor stored in its &lt;tt&gt;tracer&lt;/tt&gt; field and it is restricted to {{Class|SummoningDoll}} and derived classes.
