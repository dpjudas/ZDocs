A '''monster''' in its most basic form is an [[actor]] that has the {{flag|ISMONSTER}} flag. Normally, it would also have the {{property|Monster}} property which adds [[Actor_properties#Flag_combos|a combo of other flags that determine its behavior]].

Several effects are monster-specific, including:
*The {{c|{{CCMD|D|kill}} class}} [[console command]] can only be used to kill monsters (e.g., "{{c|kill {{Class|ExplosiveBarrel}}}}" will have no effect).
*The {{c|kill monsters}} or the {{c|massacre}} [[console command|cheat]] will kill all currently alive monsters.
*The {{CCMD|I|monster}} console command will list all currently alive monsters.
*The [[automap]] can display monsters with a different color from other things when using a scanner or the map cheat.
*Specific [[Linedef|linedefs]] on the level can be set up to block monster movement or hearing. Certain [[Special|specials]] can be set up so that monsters can activate them, as well.
*The master/children-related functions, such as [[A_KillMaster]], only work for monsters. However, the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; [[Actor pointers|pointer]] can be utilized in [[ZScript]] manually with any actor.
*Monsters are not spawned when the {{c|-nomonster}} [[command line parameter]] or the equivalent [[DM flag]] is used.
*Unless changed by the {{Property|Activation}} property, monsters activate their [[special]] when killed.
*Actors killed by ice [[damage]] and without a freeze death use the generic ice death if they are monsters or players (and do not have the {{Flag|NOICEDEATH}} flag).
*Monsters pained by electric or poison cloud damage will play their {{Property|HowlSound}}.
