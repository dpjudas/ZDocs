{{c|virtual bool '''TryPickupRestricted'''(in out Actor ''toucher'')}}

==Usage==
A [[ZScript virtual functions|virtual function]] called by {{class|Inventory}} items when they're received (either by being picked up from the world, or by being given directly). This is called in [[CallTryPickup]], right after [[TryPickup]] has been called, but only if [[CanPickup]] returns false AND the item ''doesn't'' have the {{flag|INVENTORY.RESTRICTABSOLUTELY}} flag.

Just like [[TryPickup]], this function should not be called directly, but can be overridden to add extra behavior. If you want to add behavior when an item has already been received, consider using [[AttachToOwner]] or [[Use]] instead.

=== Parameters ===
*{{c|Actor '''toucher'''}}
:The actor who is attempting to receive this item.

=== Return values ===
Returns true if the item was successfully received. Note, this doesn't guarantee that the item itself keep existing. Many classes, such as {{class|Health}}, perform their function (such as healing the toucher) and then disappear. TryPickup still returns true in this case, because technically the item was sucecssfully received.

== [[ZScript]] definition ==
{{ZScriptDefinitionNote|actors/inventory/inventory.zs#L719C1-L722C3}}
The base {{class|Inventory}} class defines it as follows:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="csharp"&gt;
	virtual bool TryPickupRestricted (in out Actor toucher)
	{
		return false;
	}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Examples ==
