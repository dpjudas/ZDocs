==Usage==

Automatically saves the game to an autosave slot.
A common usage is to split levels into pieces, so that if the player dies, he or she does not have to start from the very beginning.

*Note: using this will notify the player, so that using it right before an event will let the player know something may happen.

==Examples==

Usually this is set on a line making sure not to set it to be repeatable. If you were to be generous, you could set up a safety script like this:

 script 10 (void)
 {
 	if ([[GetActorProperty]](0, {{Const|APROP_HEALTH}}) &gt; 10)
 		[[Autosave]]();
 }

This sort of script will prevent the game from saving when the player's health is too low, as it can be considered annoying to overwrite a previous save when the player is in a dire situation.

== Conversions from linedef types ==
The following Doom map format types can be converted as Autosave:
{| {{prettytable}}
!Type!!Conversion!!Trigger
|-
|{{icon|ZDoom}}	348:W1 Autosave	|| Autosave() || Player Cross
|-
|{{icon|ZDoom}}	349:S1 Autosave	|| Autosave() || Player Use
