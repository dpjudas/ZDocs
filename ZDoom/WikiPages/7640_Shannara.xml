A 5 level replacement hub for hexen by Terry Durham

Story: Brona, the evil Warlock Lord, was thought to have been destroyed long ago by Sheah Ohmsford and the Sword of Shannara. But now, Evil has once again ravaged in the four lands as Brona is once again active. Only the power of a Mage, Warrior, or Cleric has the power to put an end to him. You must travel through the Valley of Shale, The Druid's Keep, and The Hall of Kings to reach Skull Mountain...Brona's hideout. As you leave your hideout in the Dragon's teeth, you notice the Hall of Kings straight ahead....Take the straight path, and get back once the earquake starts! That path is now lost, and another must be found to reach the Hall of Kings. This journey will take you to The Valley of Shale, where you will recieve an elfstone (ruby planet) at the hadeshorn. 2 more elftones are needed to be found. These stones are needed to open the doors to the Hall of Kings, once you get there. Brona's lair at skull mountain is dangerous. Cries from tormented souls can be heard from time to time.....just hope it is not your sou</text>
