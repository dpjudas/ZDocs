{{Special|29|tag, speed, height|Floor and Ceiling}}

* ''tag'': Tag of affected sector
* ''speed'': Speed of the build 
* ''height'': Height (relative to floor) where the floor and ceiling meet 

Raises the floor of a sector and lowers its ceiling so that they meet. The ''speed'' argument controls the speed of whichever part of the pillar has to move further, and the other part will have its speed set so that it arrives at its destination at the same time. If ''height'' is 0, then the floor and ceiling will meet halfway between their original positions. If ''tag'' is 0, then the sector on the line's back side is used.</text>
