    <text bytes="838" sha1="frusf0lj4spi705tsbtpqd7309t3qvc" xml:space="preserve">Paranormal was an on-going project that Ace was working on.  It was to be broken up into 6 episodes, with approximately 10-14 levels each.  It was to feature moderate use of ACS, DECORATE, graphics, sounds, among other things.  It also would have been quite strictly plot-based with the story moving much of the gameplay forward.


During progress of the first episode, The Prison, however, the project proved to become too large to fathom completing the series, with several months being spent on the first map of Episode I alone, so the project was cancelled. The author is now focusing on a single hub-based project called Night, as well as contributing to community/team projects, such as NDCP2, off and on.
