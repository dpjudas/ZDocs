int '''GetNetID''' (int ''tid'', int ''index'' [, int ''pointer'']);
==Usage==
This function is primarily used in conjunction with [[SetActivatorByNetID]] to get a specific actor's network ID. See [[Events and handlers#Passing objects through networks|this page]] for more information.

All actors with the specific TID are iterated through, regardless of what they are, alive or dead.

'''NOTE:''' Avoid using this to find out how many actors have a specific TID. Internally, this iterates through the internal actors every time this function is called up until it reaches the defined index, which can impact performance especially with a large index, if the number of actors with that TID is large.
===Parameters===
* ''tid'': The thing's ID number to look through. If 0, gets the activator of the script if any.
* ''index'': Specifies the index of the internal array. This is based on which actors gain 'tid' first. Ignored if TID is 0.
* ''pointer'': An [[Actor pointer#Decorate &amp; ACS|actor pointer]]. If an actor is found, attempts to get the net ID of the pointer if applicable. If the pointed actor doesn't exist, uses the found actor.

===Return value===
Returns the network ID of an actor, or 0 if nothing is found.
