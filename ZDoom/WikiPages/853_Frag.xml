On some [[server|servers]], a match will end after a player acquires a certain amount of frags, decided upon by the server using the [[cvar]] [[fraglimit]].

Frag is short for fragmentation, as in fragmentation grenade. Because of the general insanity of the Vietnam war, a lot of infighting happened. The "accidental" killing of a friendly superior officer with a fragmentation grenade during the confusion of a jungle firefight was referred to as "fragging". For example, "I didn't mean to frag LT, I was throwing for the goddamn Charlies, I swear!"

Comically enough, [[id Software]] chose to use the term for [[deathmatch]] kills in [[Doom]], presumably because you are killing fellow marines. The term came to be associated with gaming in general, whether you're killing marines or not, with grenades or anything else.
