== Bit of Info from the author== 
Always wondered why there weren't a whole lot of water-themed levels for Doom, so I just decided to go ahead and make one. It was turning out pretty good in it's early stages, but an annoying engine bug forced me to stop working on it for some time. I tried to figure out the cause but I just couldn't so I scrapped what I had and started over. 

== Story == 
When you arrived at the underwater UAC base, you noticed something wrong, there were growls and moans in the distance. All you were assigned to do is help the underwater base become fully functional. You grab your pistol and harpoon gun and get ready to face off against new horrors in the water and on land. 

== Description == 
Submerged is a 2-level wad, with a watery tech base theme for the most part. There will be underwater battles and land battles. You will be able to fight new monsters used from Tormentor667's beastiary and the Water Resource Wad, as well as a new monster, the Nightmare Imp. There is also a new weapon planned, a Harpoon Gun, that you will use when underwater.</text>
