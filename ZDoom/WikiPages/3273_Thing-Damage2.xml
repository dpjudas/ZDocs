int '''Thing_Damage2''' (int ''tid'', int ''amount'', str ''type'');

==Usage==

This is exactly the same as [[Thing_Damage]], except the damage type is specified by name.

The return value is the number of things damaged.

=== Parameters ===

* ''tid'': TID of the thing you want to damage.
* ''amount'': The amount of damage the thing will receive.
* ''type'': The damagetype to use. See [[Damage types]].

== NOTE ==
Please note that if the activator of the action is the same as the actor having damage applied to them, this will always count as a suicide, disregarding the damagetype assigned (will just display 'player killed self' message) - Please ensure if you have a damagetype assigned and want it to display the correct obituary, that you have reassigned the activator, or the activator is otherwise not the same as the damaged thing.
