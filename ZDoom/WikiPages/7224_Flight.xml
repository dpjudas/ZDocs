'''Flight''' for the player is not present in [[vanilla Doom|vanilla ''Doom'']] and ''[[Strife]]'', but implemented in ''[[Heretic]]'' and ''[[Hexen]]''. [[ZDoom]] provides flight with the {{CCMD|D|fly}} [[cheat]] and with the {{Class|PowerFlight|flight}} power granted by items such as the {{Class|ArtiFly|Wings of Wrath}}.

While flying, a player's forward and backward movements take the [[free look]] pitch into account: moving forward while looking up will cause the player to also move upward. This can be used to scale walls, as the horizontal movement is blocked but not the vertical movement.

The commands {{CCMD|P|+moveup}} and {{CCMD|P|+movedown}} can be used for pure vertical movement, regardless of view pitch. In addition, [[jumping]] will also cause the player to move upwards while flying or swimming. The {{CCMD|P|land}} command interrupts flight. To resume flying, use +moveup ({{CCMD|P|+jump}} will not resume flight).
