[[Sector_SetLink]] uses sector tags to link [[sector]]s together. However, so as to support (through a [[map translator]]) the [[Eternity Engine]] method of '''attached sectors''', it is also possible to define [[linked sectors]] with [[Static_Init]] for lines. The method used by Eternity is explained by needing to remain within the limits of the Doom [[map format]], in which [[linedef]]s can have only one argument, which serves both as its own ID, as well as to [[tag]] the sector it refers to.

To marks the linedef's front sector to be the control sector, the form is the following:
 Static_Init(lineid, 3, plane, 0)
:''lineid'' is the id of the lines whose front sector must be linked.
:''3'' is the constant to use for this type of initialization.
:''plane'' determines which plane is the control: is 0 for the floor, and 1 for the ceiling.
:''0'' marks the line as being a control line (by default).

To mark the linedef's front sector as being attached to the control plane, the form is the following:
 Static_Init(0, 3, 0, movetype)
:The first parameter is ignored there and may as well be zero.
:''3'' must remain 3, of course.
:The second parameter is also ignored there and may as well be zero.
:''movetype'' is, as explained on the Sector_SetLink page, either 1, 5, 2, 10, or a combination of those values.

To sum up, the Eternity type correspond therefore to these parameters:
{| {{prettytable}}
|379:Attach_SetCeilingControl||Static_Init(tag, 3, 1)
|-
|380:Attach_SetFloorControl||Static_Init(tag, 3, 0)
|-
|381:Attach_FloorToControl||Static_Init(0, 3, 0, 1)
|-
|382:Attach_CeilingToControl||Static_Init(0, 3, 0, 2)
|-
|383:Attach_MirrorFloorToControl||Static_Init(0, 3, 0, 5)
|-
|384:Attach_MirrorCeilingToControl||Static_Init(0, 3, 0, 10)
|}
