{{Special|30|tag, speed, fdist, cdist|Floor and Ceiling}}

* ''tag'': Tag of affected sector 
* ''speed'': Speed of the open 
* ''fdist'': How far the floor should lower 
* ''cdist'': How far the ceiling should rise 

Opens a pillar. If ''fdist'' is 0, then the pillar's floor will lower to the lowest surrounding floor. Similarly, if ''cdist'' is 0, then the pillar's ceiling will rise to the highest surrounding ceiling. The speed argument controls the speed of whichever part of the pillar has to move further, and the other part will have its speed set so that it arrives at its destination at the same time. If ''tag'' is 0, then the sector on the line's back side is used.

''Note:'' This will only work on sectors that have equal ceiling and floor heights.</text>
