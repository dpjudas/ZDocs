== Description ==

Eternal is mostly known for his "limit removing" port requiring maps, which vary from slaughter style gameplay to limit based maps. However, he does rarely make a GZDoom project. This one makes use of Dynamic Lighting, full 3D architecture, DECORATE and many other features to bring a dark wintery map to the table. Featuring black imps, white demons, "Beholders" and Revenants in Santa hats in combination with snowy trees and a vast winter wonderland, the environment presented is both odd and unique. Mixed in with a fairly brooding start to the music, the player may at first feel that he's in for a horror WAD, but as the pace picks up and the Beholders come into play, he quickly realises that this is much more.

The non-ZDoom version, without ZDoom and GZDoom features, is very different in style and atmosphere.</text>
