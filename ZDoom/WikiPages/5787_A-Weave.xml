A generalized version of [[A_BishopMissileWeave]] and [[A_CStaffMissileSlither]]. You have to call this function repeatedly to have a permanent effect.

A_BishopMissileWeave is equivalent to A_Weave(2, 2, 2.0, 1.0); A_CStaffMissileSlither is equivalent to A_Weave(3, 0, 1.0, 0.0).

=== Parameters ===
A weave in ZDoom can be understood as the sum of two waves, a horizontal and a vertical one.

*''horzspeed'': the speed at which the projectile weaves horizontally; that is to say, it affects the frequency of the horizontal wave.
*''vertspeed'': same but for the vertical wave.
*''horzdist'': the maximum distance to which the projectile will horizontally stray from its linear trajectory; that is to say, the semi-amplitude of the horizontal wave.
*''vertdist'': same but for the vertical wave.
In addition to these parameters, the actor's {{Property|WeaveIndexXY}} and {{Property|WeaveIndexZ}} properties as well as the frequency at which A_Weave is called are both instrumental in determining the exact behavior of projectile.
