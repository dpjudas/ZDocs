state '''A_Jump''' (int ''chance'', int ''offset'', ...)&lt;br&gt;
state '''A_Jump''' (int ''chance'', str "''state''", ...)
{{JumpNotice}}
== Usage ==
Randomly advances to different frame. The ''chance'' value can range between 0 and 256. A chance of 0 will never jump, while a chance of 256 will always jump. If the jump does not happen, then the frame or instruction immediately following the '''A_Jump''' will be used as if '''A_Jump''' had not been present. If more than one ''offset'' or ''state'' values are present, '''A_Jump''' will choose one of them at random.

Note that ''offset'' specifies the number of frames to skip over, and not the number of lines.  Instructions like ''goto'', ''loop'' and ''stop'' cannot be jumped to directly for this reason. (If you need the '''A_Jump''' command to skip directly to an instruction, see the last example below for a way to do this.)

Jumps made with '''A_Jump''' are virtual, i.e. if the execution pointer is currently in the state of a base class of an actor, it will jump to the redefined state (if exists) of the derived actor. This is in contrast to the ''goto'' keyword which is static and execution does not leave the base class.

''Note:'' Because of a limitation in the decorate code parser, you '''cannot''' use '''A_Jump''' on a single line if it has more than one state while using ''offset'' to specify the state to jump to. You will either need to split the states onto multiple lines and add an '''A_Jump''' to each line individually, or reference an actual state label like "'''See'''", "'''Melee'''", etc to make it work properly.

== Examples ==

The following examples are the old method of jumping without states. They are still usable but it is ''strongly'' recommended that you use state labels for convenience.

   POSS A 0 '''A_Jump''' (256, 2)
   POSS A 5
   POSS A 5 // &lt;- Jumps to this one (always)
   POSS A 5

   POSS A 0 '''A_Jump''' (127, 4)
   POSS ABC 5
   POSS D 5 // &lt;- Jumps to this one (%50 chance)
   POSS E 3

   POSS A 0 '''A_Jump''' (5, 1)
   goto Melee // &lt;- This line is skipped because it does not define a frame
   POSS A 5 // &lt;- Jumps to this one (Very little chance)
   POSS B 3

   POSS A 0 '''A_Jump''' (127, 2, 3, 6)
   POSS A 5 // &lt;-- Has a 50% chance of dropping through to here (no jump), otherwise...
   goto Death
   POSS B 6 // &lt;-- Jumps here...
   goto See
   POSS BCD 5 // &lt;-- Or here...
   goto Death
   POSS E -1 // &lt;-- Or here, with equal probability.

These examples use state labels. As you can see from both methods, state labels are a much simpler way of doing jumps.
 
   POSS A 0 '''A_Jump''' (127, "Pain")
   POSS ABC 3
   Stop
   Pain: // &lt;-- 50% chance to jump to this state
   POSS G 3
   POSS G 3 [[A_Pain]] // Play pain sound
   loop

   POSS A 0 '''A_Jump''' (256, "Boogie", "Gasp", "Death") // &lt;-- Always jumps to either...
   Stop
   Boogie: // &lt;-- This state...
   POSS ABCD 4
   loop
   Gasp: // &lt;-- This state...
   POSS E 15
   Goto See
   Death: // &lt;-- Or this state at an equal chance.
   POSS H 5
   POSS I 5 [[A_Scream]]
   POSS J 5 [[A_NoBlocking]]
   POSS K 5
   POSS L -1
   stop

Here is a real example of where jumping to different states would be useful. This is a custom made [[DECORATE]] version of {{Class|Korax|Korax's}} attack pattern using state jumps.
