Any graphic in a supported [[image format]] that is between these markers is immediately treated as a texture/flat. Sadly, it has some downsides. These textures will override textures of the same name in the flats or walltexture [[namespace]]s. TX_START/END textures and flats cannot be "multi-patch" or scaled bigger and smaller like the usual TEXTUREx textures. They can still be warped, however. The only [[level editor|level editors]] that currently support its use are [[DeePsea]], [[Doom Builder]], and [[SLADE 3]].

If you are using ZIPs as WAD replacement then you can simply use a directory called "Textures".
