'''DZDoom''' (also called '''GEC: Master Edition''') is a {{wp|Fork (software development)|fork}} of the [[GZDoom]] [[source port]] by Team GEC, which consists of members Chris194, Erick194 and Gerardo194. It is based off GZDoom 1.9.1. 

Although it can be used as a general port, it specifically focuses on improving the rendering compatibility of the following games: Doom for Sony PlayStation, Final Doom (PlayStation) and Doom 64, providing a more authentic and accurate experience. It gets its inspiration from Doom64 EX, reimplementing many elements from it.

In order to support the new features implemented in their port, a custom fork of [[Doom Builder 2|GZDoom Builder]] is used which supports all of Doom 64's and PlayStation Doom's features, including custom colored lighting.

==Features==
* All features from ZDoom 2.8.1 and GZDoom 1.9.1 ([[ACS]], etc)
** OpenGL 2.0 based renderer
* Gradient lighting as seen in Doom 64
* Sector coloring for Doom 64 (sector coloring was introduced in GZDoom 2.4.0)
* Fog rendering (Doom 64)
* Colored lighting as seen in Doom for the PlayStation
* Exact damage flashes (Doom 64/PlayStaton Doom)
* Maps are converted to [[UDMF]] with a specialized converter
* Correct music support for the soundtracks by Aubrey Hodges

==Future==
The port will move to a new codebase and will actively be marketed as DZDoom from there on out. Current progress includes investigating the [[LZDoom]] source port for consideration. At release, the port will be known as DZDoom or '''DarkZDoom''' in full.
