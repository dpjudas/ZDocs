== Description ==
[[File:FortressOfDsparil02.png|thumb|Not shown here: a nasty trap.]]
'''Fortress of D'Sparil''' is a single-level map for Heretic, taking the E3M8 slot. This allows it to replace the normal confrontation with D'Sparil in Heretic's third episode, though it is balanced for a "wand start". Nevertheless, as a result, it is not possible to jump directly to the new map from the menu, one has to use the &lt;tt&gt;-warp&lt;/tt&gt; [[command line parameter]], the &lt;tt&gt;map&lt;/tt&gt; [[console command]], or the &lt;tt&gt;engage&lt;/tt&gt; cheat code to reach it.

The map uses relatively few ZDoom features, and offers therefore an overall classic look-and-feel. The textures for liquids (water, lava) are replaced by [[ANIMDEFS|warping variants]]. [[ACS]] is used sparingly but effectively, though the instant-death trap behind the green doors can be a little frustrating. The final fight is made extremely challenging and you are advised to keep all your {{class|ArtiHealth|quartz flasks}} and {{class|ArtiSuperHealth|mystic urns}} for it, in addition to as many ammunition as possible.

This map served as a base for MAP02 of [[Resurrection of Chaos]].</text>
