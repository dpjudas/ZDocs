{{c|native clearscope bool '''IsHostile'''(Actor ''other'') const}}

== Usage ==
Checks if the calling actor is hostile to the ''other'' actor. This is meant to be run on [[Monster|monsters]] to determine their allegiance.

This is not a direct opposite of [[IsFriend]], since the set of checks is slightly different.

=== Parameters ===
*{{c|Actor '''other'''}}
:[[Actor pointers|Pointer]] to the actor, whose allegiance should be compared to.

=== Return values ===
If neither the calling actor, nor the ''other'' actor has the {{flag|FRIENDLY}} flag, the function returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. They can still become hostile to each other under specific conditions, the [[Infighting|infighting]] rules allow it.

If at least one of the actors has the {{flag|FRIENDLY}} the function performs a sequence of checks, similar to the inverted {{c|[[IsFriend]]}}:

:In team deathmatch, the function returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; if ANY of the below conditions are met:
:*The calling actor and ''other'' are [[IsTeammate|teammates]]
:*The calling actor and ''other'' are allied to players who are [[IsTeammate|teammates]] (the allied players are determined by the value of the actors' &lt;code&gt;FriendPlayer&lt;/code&gt; fields)

:In other game modes, the function returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; if ANY of the below conditions are met:
:*The game mode is NOT [[deathmatch]]
:*The calling actor and ''other'' are allied to the same player
:*The calling actor and ''other'' are allied players who are [[IsTeammate|teammates]]
If none of the above mentioned conditions were met, the function returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.
