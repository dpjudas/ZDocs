Urban Brawl Multiplayer is a modification for [[Action Doom 2: Urban Brawl]] that lets players play through the levels of Action Doom 2 with a friend or more by fixing numerous issues that prevent playing the game and its maps in Multiplayer modes, additionally it also includes plenty of fixes to the game maps to make them work without issues in hardware renderer and fixes scripts that don't work on the latest version of GZDoom.
