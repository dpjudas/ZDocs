The '''network options''' menu contains various multiplayer specific settings, which will generally only have any effect in a [[multiplayer]] game. Its [[MENUDEF]] name is {{c|NetworkOptions}}.
*'''{{LE|Movement prediction|cl_noprediction}}''' (Off/On)
:{{c|{{CVAR|C|cl_noprediction}}}}
:Lets you switch off latency movement prediction, at the cost of not having responsive input depending on your netgame latency.
*'''{{LE|Predict line actions|cl_predict_specials}}''' (On/Off)
:{{c|{{CVAR|C|cl_predict_specials}}}}
:If switched on, allows some line specials, such as silent teleporters, to have the actions predicted by player prediction. Requires the above movement prediction option to also be on.


*'''{{LE|Extra Tics|net_extratic}}''' (None/1/All unacknowledged)
:{{c|{{CVAR|C|net_extratic}}}}
:Controls if and how many extra inputs get sent for each message. 1 is the same as, and implied by, [[Command_line_parameters#-extratic|-extratic]], and "All unacknowledged" is every tic that is currently missing a response.
*'''{{LE|Latency balancing|net_ticbalance}}''' (On/Off)
:{{c|{{CVAR|C|net_ticbalance}}}}
:Controls if a P2P game uses latency balancing. If switched on, all nodes will attempt to send messages in advance to match when they would receive eachothers. In a 2 player game, this has the effect of halving network latency.
