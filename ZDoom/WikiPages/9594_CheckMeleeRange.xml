Bool '''CheckMeleeRange''' (Double ''Range'' = -1)

== Usage ==
Checks if the calling actor is within melee range of his target. This function is used by several other internal functions such as [[A_Chase]]

=== Parameters ===

*''Range'': The range the check should use. Default is -1, which means that the range of the check corresponds to the callers' {{property|MeleeRange}} instead.

== Return value ==
Returns true if the caller can perform a melee attack to his target. False if not, the conditions that make the check fail are as follows:

* The caller is inside a sector with the [[Sector_flags|SECF_NOATTACK]] flag on.
* The target is out of the callers' range.
* The target is above the callers' height, or below the callers' bottom. And the caller doesn't have the {{flag|NOVERTICALMELEERANGE}} flag.
* Both the caller and the target are {{flag|FRIENDLY|friendly}} monsters that work for the same player.
* The target is out of the callers' sight.

== Examples ==
This big Imp has a much more powerful attack than his normal counterparts. But he first calls CheckMeleeRange with a custom range of 128, to make sure that he is able to use his melee.

 Class BigImp : {{class|DoomImp}}
 {
 	Default
 	{
 		Health 250;
 		Radius 30;
 		Height 84;
 		Mass 250;
 		Speed 6;
 		Scale 1.5;
 		PainChance 150;
 	}
 	States
 	{
 		Missile:
 			TNT1 A 0 A_JumpIf (CheckMeleeRange(128),"BigMelee");
 			TROO EF 10 A_FaceTarget();
 			TROO G 8 A_SpawnProjectile ("DoomImpBall",48);
 			Goto See;
 		BigMelee:
 			TROO EF 12 A_FaceTarget();
 			TROO G 10 A_CustomMeleeAttack (10 * Random (1, 8),"Imp/Melee");
 			Goto See;
 	}
 }
