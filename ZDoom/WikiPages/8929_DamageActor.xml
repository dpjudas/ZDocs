int '''DamageActor''' (int ''targettid'', int ''targetptr'', int ''inflictortid'', int ''inflictorptr'', int ''damage'', str ''damagetype'');

==Usage==
Damages a single actor with a specific damage amount and [[damage type]]. You can optionally specify another actor as having done the damage, affecting the obituary and targeting of the target actor.

===Parameters===
*''targettid'': the {{c|tid}} of the actor to damage. You may specify 0 to refer to the activator.
*''targetptr'': the [[actor pointer]] to use on the target actor.
*''inflictortid'': the {{c|tid}} of the actor inflicting the damage. You may specify 0 to refer to the activator.
*''inflictorptr'': the actor pointer to use on the inflicting actor. {{c|AAPTR_NULL}} will make the damage originate from the world.
*''damage'': the amount of damage the target actor will receive. Negative values are clamped to zero (you cannot heal with this function).
*''damagetype'': the damagetype to use. See [[Damage types]].

===Return value===
The function returns the amount of damage the target actor actually received, after all the factors have been processed (such as skill level and damage factors). If the damaging was cancelled (e.g. by invulnerability), or if no target actor was found, -1 is returned.
