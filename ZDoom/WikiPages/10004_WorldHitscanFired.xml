{{c|void '''WorldHitscanFired''' (WorldEvent ''e'')}} {{new|4.14.0}}

== Usage ==
An [[Events and handlers|event handler]] virtual function that is called after a [[hitscan|hitscan attack]] has been fired in the level. In contrast to [[WorldHitscanPreFired|{{c|WorldHitscan''Pre''Fired}}]], this event cannot prevent the attack from happening, but it can be used to apply some kind of extra effects based on the attack (for example, spawn visual tracers or something else).

'''Notes:'''
* This event is triggered by "bullet" hitscan attack function, such as [[LineAttack (ZScript)|{{c|LineAttack()}}]] or any of its derivatives. However, it's NOT triggered by "railgun" functions such as [[RailAttack|{{c|RailAttack()}}]]; for a similar railgun-related function see [[WorldRailgunFired|{{c|World''Railgun''Fired}}]].
* A separate event is triggered for ''every'' hitscan "bullet".

=== Passed values ===
This event gets a pointer to the {{struct|WorldEvent}} struct, and can read certain fields from it preceding the value with &lt;code&gt;e.&lt;/code&gt;.
*{{c|Actor '''thing'''}}
:A pointer to the actor who fired the attack.
*{{c|Vector3 '''AttackPos'''}}
:World coordinates of the point from which the attack originated. (Normally this would be the position of the shooter with their attack height added on top.)
*{{c|Vector3 '''DamagePosition'''}}
:World coordinates of the point where the attack hit.
*{{c|Actor '''Inflictor'''}}
:The [[puff]] that was used by the attack.
*{{c|int '''AttackLineFlags'''}}
:The flags passed from the attack function. These are the same as the [[LineAttack (ZScript)|{{c|LineAttack()}}]] flags:
{{: LAF flags}}

The direction vector from the attack origin to the point where it ended can be calculated with [[Structs:LevelLocals#Vec3Diff|{{c|level.Vec3Diff(e.AttackPos, e.DamagePosition).Unit()}}]].

== Examples ==
This event handler simply prints information on the screen and to the console whenever a hitscan attack is fired:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cs"&gt;
class HitscanInfoHandler: EventHandler
{
	override void WorldHitscanFired(WorldEvent e)
	{
		Console.MidPrint(smallfont, String.Format(
			"Hitscan fired:"
			"\nAttacker: \cd%s\c-"
			"\nAttack pos: \cd%d, %d, %d\c-"
			"\nDamage pos: \cd%d, %d, %d\c-"
			"\nInflictor: \cd%s\c-",
			e.thing.GetClassName(),
			e.attackpos.x, e.attackpos.y, e.attackpos.z,
			e.damagePosition.x, e.damagePosition.y, e.damagePosition.z,
			e.inflictor? e.inflictor.GetClassName() : 'none'));
	}
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
