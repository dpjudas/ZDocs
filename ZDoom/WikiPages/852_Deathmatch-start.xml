It determines where players will spawn in a [[Deathmatch]] game, both at the beginning of a match and upon being [[frag|fragged]]. The deathmatch start at which a player spawns is normally chosen randomly, and it is best to include more to make the match less predictable and hence less susceptible to being ruined by spawn-camping.

ZDoom includes an optional dmflag, "Spawn Farthest", which forces the respawn code to attempt to find and use the deathmatch start furthest away from all other players when respawning a player.  In theory, this gives the respawning player more of a chance to get his bearings and locate a weapon before the other players find and attempt to kill him again.
