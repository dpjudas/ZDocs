== Description ==

Titan, released in late 2004, is a level set on Titan, one of Saturn's moons, consisting of 9 single player/cooperative levels for Doom 2. Some [[ZDoom]] features such as colored lighting, slopes and submersible water are used, as is scripting. The levels are mostly linear, with the player starting out at a mineral storage facility and eventually making his way into the planet's core, which somehow turns out to be a way into Hell. The gameplay is run n' gun, with plenty of monsters to fight, especially in the later levels. A few new monsters are also present. The early levels of Titan may seem a bit amateurish, but the WAD improves noticeably as you progress through the levels. Highlights include various traps, a tricky cyberdemon battle and the final level.</text>
