== Usage ==

Returns the game type currently being played.

=== Return value ===

The game type currently being played. For readability there are definitions defined in zdefs.acs as follows:

*'''GAME_SINGLE_PLAYER''' = 0
:Solo play.
*'''GAME_NET_COOPERATIVE''' = 1
:Cooperative net game.
*'''GAME_NET_DEATHMATCH''' = 2
:Deathmatch net game.
*'''GAME_TITLE_MAP''' = 3
:[[TITLEMAP|Title map]]

== Examples ==

With this command it is possible to do things such as give an explanation about the map to the player.

 script 1 [[Script types|ENTER]]
 {
     if ([[GameType]]() != {{const|GAME_NET_DEATHMATCH}})
         [[Print]] (s:"This is a deathmatch only map!");
     else
         [[Print]] (s:"BobDM1\nBy Bob");
 }

Another use could be to unlock extra areas in GAME_NET_COOPERATIVE mode like in the example below, where all doors with a sector tag of 666 are opened, the level music is changed, and a message is printed if playing in co-op.

 Script "OpenCooperativeAreas" [[Script types|OPEN]]
 {
 	If ([[GameType]]() == {{const|GAME_NET_COOPERATIVE}})
 	{
 		[[Door_Open]] (666,16,0);
 		[[SetMusic]] ("COOPMUSIC");
 		[[PrintBold]] (s:"New areas have been unlocked in CO-OP mode!");
 	}
 }
