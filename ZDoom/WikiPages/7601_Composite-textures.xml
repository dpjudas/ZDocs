They are defined either in [[TEXTUREx]] lumps, as in [[vanilla Doom]] and the original engine for the other supported games; or with the more advanced [[TEXTURES]] lump.

When a texture is composited from a [[patch]], the raw pixels from the patch are added to the texture, transformed if desired by translations, rotations, mirroring, or blending. The texture does not "remember" that it is made from this patch; a texture's graphic data, once composition is over, is only a collection of pixels. Special effects applied on a patch graphic (such as animation, or [[OpenGL]] [[GLDEFS#Brightmaps|brightmaps]]) are not transferred to the composite texture.
