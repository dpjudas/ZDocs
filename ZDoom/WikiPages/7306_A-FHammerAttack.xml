'''A_FHammerAttack'''&lt;br&gt;
(''no parameter'')&lt;br&gt;

Works similarly to [[A_FPunchAttack]].  The range is narrowed to 45 degrees as well as the hit distance being reduced to 1.5 times the normal melee range or 96 units.  The attack will deal 60-123 points of damage and thrust monsters back with a strength of 10.  {{Class|HammerPuff}} is used on a successful hit (either wall or enemy) and special1 is set to 0 otherwise it is set to 1.  When unsuccessful, it will also check if the player has enough ammo to throw a hammer, and if not, sets special1 back to 0.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|FWeapHammer}} and derived classes.</text>
