'''A_SorcSpinBalls'''&lt;br&gt;
(''no parameter'')&lt;br&gt;

Moves the Spawn state label up two frames.  This is done so that this function is only called once.

The first argument is set to 0 to indicate that the Heresiarch has no defenses.  The third (target orbit speed) and fifth (current orbit speed) argument is set to 7 (SORCBALL_INITIAL_SPEED), and the forth (movement mode) to 5 (SORC_NORMAL).  Special1 (ball angle) is also set to 1 degree.

Finally {{Class|SorcBall1}} is spawned immediately above the calling actor and has special2 set to 18 (SORCFX4_RAPIDFIRE_TIME), and {{Class|SorcBall2}} and {{Class|SorcBall3}} are spawned in the same location.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|Heresiarch}} and derived classes.</text>
