#Tally: this screen (not seen in [[hub]]s) debriefs on the finished [[level]], providing the player's score in killing monsters, finding secrets and picking up items. It also presents the name of the next level. In [[Doom]] and [[Heretic]], these screens are used to present a [[intermission script|scripted overworld map]] showing the player's progression.
#Story: this screen or series of screen narrates the story so far with text or images. This, too, can be scripted, using an [[intermission definition]] in [[MAPINFO]].
