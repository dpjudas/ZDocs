'''DeuTex''' is a WAD composing utility initially released in 1994. It uses a command line interface rather than a graphical interface, in order to ease WAD composing using scripts. As of 2017, development has been revived and it slowly gains more modern features, such as [[PNG]] support, while at the same time, getting rid of old bugs and limitations. As of July 2017, DeuTex 5.0.0 is the latest version available.

An graphical user interface version, named [[WinTex]], is available but it is outdated and not likely to to be updated.
