[[ZDoom]] uses cluster for two main purposes: [[hub]]s and [[episode]]s. In a hub, all visited maps that are part of the same cluster as the current map are kept in memory. This allows to find them as they were left each time. In episodes, be they self-contained like in [[Doom]] or sequential like in [[Doom II]], clusters are only used for [[intermission]] screens.

Cluster are [[Cluster definition|defined]] in [[MAPINFO]].
