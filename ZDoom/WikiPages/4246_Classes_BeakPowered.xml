The powered-up beak is a more damaging version of the standart chicken beak, however, unlike other powered-up weapons, it is not obtained through the use of a {{class|ArtiTomeOfPower|Tome of Power}}, as using this artifact while morphed into a [[Classes:ChickenPlayer|chicken]] puts an end to the transformation. Instead, a morphed player must kill another player with the normal beak and the powered-up version of the chicken weapon is automatically earned.
