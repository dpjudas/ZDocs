It starts at 0 and maxes at 100. The lower the accuracy, the more player attacks tend to err wildly off course.

Accuracy is increased by {{Class|UpgradeAccuracy}} items which are granted at various points during the game.

It can be set for custom actors with the {{Property|Accuracy}} property, accessed from [[ACS]] with [[ACS actor properties|APROP_Accuracy]], and used in [[DECORATE expressions]].

The [[alternate HUD]] will show the player's current accuracy and [[stamina]] if {{c|hud_showstats}} is true.
