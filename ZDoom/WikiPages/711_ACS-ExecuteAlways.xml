{{Special|226|script, map, s_arg1, s_arg2, s_arg3|ACS|ExecuteAlways}}

* ''script'': Script to execute 
* ''map'': Map which contains the script 
* ''s_arg1'': First argument passed to the script 
* ''s_arg2'': Second argument passed to the script 
* ''s_arg3'': Third argument passed to the script 

==Usage==

Like [[ACS_Execute]], this special starts a [[script]]. However, it will allow multiple instances of a script to run simultaneously. The downside is that any scripts started with this special cannot be suspended or terminated with [[ACS_Suspend]] or [[ACS_Terminate]], respectively.

A common use for this special is in multiplayer games, when more than one player may need to run a script at the same time. A script executed with [[ACS_Execute]] by one player would not be triggered by another if they attempt to trigger it while it is still running. In fact, the script does not run at all. '''ACS_ExecuteAlways''' can be used to prevent this problem by being able to run multiple instances at once, one for each player.

==Examples==

This example shows how '''ACS_ExecuteAlways''' can be an advantage over '''ACS_Execute'''. The script regenerates health for a player while they remain within the sector it is activated from.

 int InSector[8];
 
 script 10 (void)
 {
      InSector&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[PlayerNumber]]()&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = {{const|true}};
 
      while (InSector&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[PlayerNumber]]()&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) {
           [[GiveInventory]]("{{Class|HealthBonus}}", 1);
           [[ThingSound]](0, "special/regen", 127);
           [[delay]](15);
      }
 }
             
 script 11 (void)
 {
      InSector&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[PlayerNumber]]()&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = {{const|false}};
 }

Script 10 is called by an [[Classes:SecActEnter|"Actor Enters Sector"]] thing using '''ACS_ExecuteAlways'''. It sets a flag variable to true and loops until the flag is false. Script 11 is called by an [[Classes:SecActExit|"Actor Leaves Sector"]] thing, and unsets the flag variable. The flag system is necessary because the script cannot be ended simply by using [[ACS_Terminate]] on it.

Because this script is using '''ACS_ExecuteAlways''' instead of [[ACS_Execute]], it is possible for eight (or more) copies of the script to be active at once&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; one for each player in the game.
