=Heavenly Hell=

* Heavenly Hell is a 10 Map Project by the two Zdoom Members Darbyjack and Bouncy. Darbyjack is the one doing the maps, while Bouncy is doing the Decorate and other coding stuffs.

* Now, Heavenly Hell would typically be your 'normal project' with the exception of this; it not only adds new goodies to the levels, like new monsters or weapons {although not a huge amount, this isn't the WRW/MRW :)}, but it improves the originals slightly or gives them new surprises. Most projectiles will more than likely have a trail effect to look a bit more neat. Monsters will have a new attack or two or some other feature of them is changed. Example; DoomImps can have ghosts come out of their bodies when they die.

* At the end of every level, there will be a last ditch effort to try to stop you from going to the next. These last ditch efforts are known as Guardians, and it's essentially a miniboss or boss fight. Each Guardian is intent on seeing your head on a spike, so don't take them lightly!

Heavenly Hell also has a few goodies from Heretic and Hexen. :)

Lastly, Most of the more important items in the game {health pickups, powerups, etc.} will now be able to be picked up into your inventory.

Not much to update upon, really. The Mancubus has been finished and now has a new attack, fixed a few apparant bugs with the alt-fires of the weapons. - Bouncy
