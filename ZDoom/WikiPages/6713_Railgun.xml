Although ZDoom itself does not provide weapons or enemies using it, the [[codepointer]]s are there: [[A_RailAttack]] for weapons, [[A_MonsterRail]] and [[A_CustomRailgun]] for monsters.

The railgun effect in ZDoom classifies neither as a [[hitscan]] nor as a [[projectile]] attack. It consists in a line that hits instantaneously and pierces through [[actor]]s, obstacle and enemies alike, until it hits a wall, surrounded by a [[particle]] helix. However, [[autoaim]] does not work on player rail attacks, so [[free look]] is required.

[[Skulltag]] features the {{class|Railgun|railgun}} as a standard weapon.

Although real {{wp|railgun|railguns}} exist, a portable version remains a sci-fi prospect for a number of practical reasons.
