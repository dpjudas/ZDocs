=== ZenNode 1.2.1 ===
Important Update - Includes RMB Functionality

July 25 2004 - The great nodes builder, ZenNode, has been updated to version 1.2.1. to include nearly all of the functionality of the REJECT utility, RMB (Reject Map Builder). You can get it at the ZenNode website or here on the Nodes page in my Downloads section.

ZenNode has always built the REJECT data with more efficiency than RMB did even in PERFECT mode; but now it recognizes RMB response files as well, which are used to hold parameters for effects like SAFE and BLIND. ZenNode supports the following options: BAND, BLIND, DISTANCE, EXCLUDE, INCLUDE, INVERT, LENGTH, PERFECT, PROCESS, and SAFE. In addition to its REJECT features, ZenNode is still possibly the fastest nodes builder around and is distributed with the level editor Doom Builder, and incorporated with editors such as DETH and XWE.

You can see my article "Optimizing the REJECT" if you're unfamiliar with REJECT tools or what they're for. I'll be releasing a new article explaining ZenNode's new features in detail soon.
