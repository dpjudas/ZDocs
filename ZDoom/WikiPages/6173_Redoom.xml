Redoom is a simple and small 5-level wad inspired by Knee-Deep in ZDoom, it is about a remake of 4 levels (with 1 secret level) of Doom 2 adding new rooms, for single player only, each level is the first one of every episode:
* RAP01: Remake of MAP01, it is totally new level with the same theme of MAP01.
* RAP02: Remake of MAP07, it has a lava theme.
* RAP03: Remake of MAP12, a mix between MAP06 and MAP12.
* RAP04: Remake of MAP21.
* RAP05: Secret level, not a remake.

== Features ==
* Skulltag's monster [[Classes:Belphegor|Belphegor]] is in this wad.

* 5 levels with a secret.</text>
