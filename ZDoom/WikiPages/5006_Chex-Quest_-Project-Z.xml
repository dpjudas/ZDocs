==About==
'''''Chex Quest: Project Z''''' is a [[GZDoom]] mod. It is stand-alone with its own IWAD. However, Tapika/Zorchdude cannot identify what a WAD needs to be an IWAD, so he just renamed chex.wad.

==Story==
The flemoids have returned &amp;mdash; but this time their attack patterns are less random. They are under the control of an escaped experiment, Project Z! Now you must fight not only against Flemoids, but Hydraks, Soggs and other rogue species!

==Enemies==
There are many flemoids. Here is a list of the common ones.

*Flemoidus Commonus (Zombieman)
*Flemoidus Bipedicus (Shotgunguy)
*Flemoidus Bipedicus Ultricus (Imp)
*Flemoidus Larvae (Demon (Uses Spectre slot))
*Flemoidus Cycloptis (Demon)
*Flemoidus Cycloptis Ultricus (Cacodemon)
*Flemoidus Quadrumpus (Imp (Uses StealthArachnotron slot))
*Flemoidus Calamus (Lost Soul)
*Flemoidus Stridicus (Renevant)

There are also a few Soggs- They look like flemoids but are more powerful.

*Soggatus Commonus
*Soggatus Bipedicus
*Soggatus Larvae

And of course, the common Hydraks.

*Hydra Commonus
*Hydra Gladiatus
*Hydra Vertus

==DECORATE use==
Everything is redone in DECORATE except the decorations (Oh, the irony)</text>
