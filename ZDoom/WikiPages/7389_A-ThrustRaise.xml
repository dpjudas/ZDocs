'''A_ThrustRaise'''&lt;br&gt;
(''no parameter'')&lt;br&gt;

Decreases the floor clipping by the number of map units stored in special2 each call until it is fully revealed.  When revealed, the first argument is set to 1 (raised) and if the second argument (bloody) is non-zero will jump to the BloodThrustInit2 state, otherwise jumps to the ThrustInit2 state.

On the first call after being invisible, the {{Class|DirtClump}} created by [[A_ThrustInitDn]] will be destroyed.

The function has a 16% chance of spawning dirt particles in the same manner as [[A_WraithRaise]].

Finally, special2 is incremented by one to increase the speed.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|ThrustFloor}} and derived classes.</text>
