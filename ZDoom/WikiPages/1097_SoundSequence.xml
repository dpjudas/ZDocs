== Usage ==

Plays a sound sequence defined in [[SNDSEQ]] lump.

== Examples ==
First off, you have to make sure you have got a sequence set up in the [[SNDSEQ]] lump, for example:

   :Heartbeat
        volume 127
        playuntildone world/heart
        volume 64
        playuntildone world/heart
    end

Just a simple sequence that plays a loop of a beating heart&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; first time at full volume and the second time at half volume.

To have this play in your level, you need to call it in a script. A very, very simple and easy to use script.

 Script 1 (void)
 {
     [[SoundSequence]] ("Heartbeat");
 }

The script can be executed by having a linedef with special 80 ([[ACS_Execute]]) and the script number as argument; the linedef itself be set to “Player Crosses Line”.
