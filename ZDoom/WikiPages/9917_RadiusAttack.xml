'''{{class|Actor}}'''

native int '''RadiusAttack'''(Actor ''bombsource'', int ''bombdamage'', double ''bombdistance'', Name ''bombmod'' = 'none', int ''flags'' = RADF_HURTSOURCE, double ''fulldamagedistance'' = 0.0, name ''species'' = "None")

== Usage ==
Performs a radius attack, dealing damage and/or thrusting the victims. This is used internally by '''[[A_Explode]]''', '''[[A_Detonate]]''' and '''[[A_RadiusThrust]]'''.

=== Parameters ===
*{{c|Actor '''bombsource'''}}
:Pointer to the actor that should be considered the source of the attack (the shooter). When calling in projectiles, use &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt;.
*{{c|int '''bombdamage'''}}
:Damage to deal.
*{{c|double '''bombdistance'''}}
:The radius of the attack.
*{{c|Name '''bombmod''}}
:[[Damage type]] of the attack. Default is 'none'.
*{{c|int '''flags'''}}
:Flags use by the attack. These are NOT the same as flags used by [[A_Explode]], but their meanings are largely similar. Multiple flags can be combined with &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;:
:*{{c|RADF_HURTSOURCE}} — '''Set by default'''. The attack will hurt the ''bombsource'' actor (same as {{c|XF_HURTSOURCE}} in [[A_Explode]]).
:*{{c|RADF_NOIMPACTDAMAGE}} — victims will not receive impact damage when colliding with something after being pushed by the explosion
:*{{c|RADF_SOURCEISSPOT}} — the calling actor is considered to be the source (same as {{c|XF_NOTMISSILE}} in [[A_Explode]])
:*{{c|RADF_NODAMAGE}} — deal no damage, only thrust the victims (same as {{c|RTF_NOIMPACTDAMAGE}} in [[A_RadiusThrust]]))
:*{{c|RADF_THRUSTZ}} — apply thrust to the victims' vertical velocity, not only horizontal (same as {{c|RTF_THRUSTZ}} in [[A_RadiusThrust]]))
:*{{c|RADF_OLDRADIUSDAMAGE}} — {{moreinfo}}
:*{{c|RADF_THRUSTLESS}} — deal damage but don't thrust (same as {{c|XF_THRUSTLESS}} in {{c|A_Explode}})
:*{{c|RADF_NOALLIES}} — don't affect the allies of the ''bombsource'' actor
:*{{c|RADF_CIRCULAR}} — changes the shape of the explosion from the vanilla cuboid shape into a spherical shape (same as {{c|XF_CIRCULAR}} in [[A_Explode]])
:*{{c|RADF_CIRCULARTHRUST}} — Blast actors away with more physically accurate momentum. When enabled, RADF_THRUSTZ is ignored. {{new|4.13.0}} 
*{{c|double '''fulldamagedistance'''}}
:The area within which full damage is inflicted. Beyond that area the damage will be subjected to linear falloff, tapering off at full ''bombdistance''.
*{{c|name '''species'''}}
:If not &lt;code&gt;'none'&lt;/code&gt;, only actors whose {{property|Species}} matches this name will be affected.

=== Return values ===
*int — returns the number of actors affected by the attack.

== Examples ==
{{noexamples}}

* [[A_RadiusThrust]]
