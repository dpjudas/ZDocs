{{Wad| name = Nazi Zombies
| author = Bobvorn
| status = Abandoned
| iwad = Doom2
}}

== Description ==

You and up to three friends will have to battle your way through wave after wave of Nazi zombies. Each level has unlimited waves for you survive. Do you have what it takes?

This mod currently has 1 level but if anyone would feel like helping by creating some more it would help make this mod a lot better.

(In great need of a good artist. I need Nazi zombie sprites!! and a couple of weapon sprites but I can probably rip those from another game.)

Weapons:

  slot 1: fist / chainsaw
  slot 2: pistol / raygun
  slot 3: shotgun / super shotgun
  slot 4: chaingun / machinegun
  slot 5: rockets / grenades
  slot 6: plasma gun / railgun
  slot 7: BFG / ?health?

== Progress ==

  Weapons : 20% (need sprites)
  Level 1 : 100%
  Monsters : 50% (need sprites)

== Sad Face ==

Because of a slight problem with my computer and managed to lose all my data and filefront seems to have lost my file I can not continue making this wad. If anybody has it and would be willing to give it back to be it would be greatly appreciated so i can keep working on it.</text>
