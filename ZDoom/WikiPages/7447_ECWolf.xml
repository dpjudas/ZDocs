It is developed by ZDoom co-developer [[User:Blzut3|Blzut3]] and integrates many elements of ZDoom, including [[DECORATE]]. In addition, it replaces several ''Wolfenstein 3D'' concepts by ''Doom'' ones (such as sprites identified by their name, frame, and rotation), with the aim of making modding much easier.

== ZDoom features supported or planned ==
* [[ACS]] (with differences as appropriate)
* [[ANIMDEFS]]
* [[DECORATE]] (with "half-length" frames possible, to account for ''Wolf'''s 70 Hz ticrate vs. Doom's 35 Hz.)
* [[FONTDEFS]]
* [[LANGUAGE]]
* [[LOCKDEFS]]
* [[MAPINFO]]
* [[SNDINFO]]
* [[Stacked sectors]]
* [[TEXTCOLO]]
* [[TEXTURES]]
* ZDoom's supported [[archive format]]s
* ZDoom's supported [[image format]]s (except [[Build tiles]])

In addition, a new map format inspired from [[UDMF]] is supported, called ''Universal Wolf Map Format''.
