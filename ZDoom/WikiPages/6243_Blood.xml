[[ZDoom]] can read Blood's encrypted RFF archives and offers support for its [[sound format]] and related features, including using the [[Bloodbath Announcer]] ("BBA") for deathmatch games.

[[User:Randy Heit|Randy]] had reverse-engineered more of Blood's data structures, but lost this work in a hard drive crash. Comments in ZDoom's source code explain that if Monolith ever released Blood's source code, a "ZBlood" port would have to be expected.
