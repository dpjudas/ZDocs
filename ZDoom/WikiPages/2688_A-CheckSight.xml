state '''A_CheckSight''' (str "''state''")
{{JumpNotice}}
Jumps if there is no possible line of sight between the center of the calling actor and that of any player pawn.

This function does not account for whether or not a player is actually ''looking'' at the calling actor or not; as long as there is a ''possible'' line of sight (i.e. at least one player is in a position where they ''could'' see the calling actor if they faced the right direction), no jump will occur. And on the other hand, the jump might happen even though the actor is partially seen by a player.

Note that '''A_CheckSight''' also counts for actors being viewed through cameras and co-op spy. It does not check if the actor is being viewed through a camera texture.

== Examples ==

The following actor fades out and disappears from the map once killed, but will not do so until out of sight of all players.  Useful for open maps with a high body count, to reduce possible lag.

  actor FadingZombie : Zombieman
  {
    States
    {
    Death:
      POSS H 5
      POSS I 5 [[A_Scream]]
      POSS J 5 [[A_NoBlocking]]
      POSS K 5
      // intentional fallthrough
    DeathWait:
      POSS L 1 '''A_CheckSight'''("DeathFade")
      loop
    DeathFade:
      POSS L 1 [[A_FadeOut]](0.02)
      loop
    XDeath:
      POSS M 5
      POSS N 5 [[A_XScream]]
      POSS O 5 A_NoBlocking
      POSS PQRST 5
      // intentional fallthrough
    XDeathWait:
      POSS U 1 '''A_CheckSight'''("XDeathFade")
      loop
    XDeathFade:
      POSS U 1 A_FadeOut(0.02)
      loop
    Raise:
      stop    // not fair to have the monster revivable just because it's in LOS
    }
  }
