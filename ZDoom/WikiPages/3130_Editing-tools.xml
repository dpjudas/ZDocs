== Lump management tools ==
A '''lump management tool''' is a program that allows you to alter the contents of a WAD file such as sounds, graphics, music, or [[special lumps]]. This is different than a level editor which is specialized for making levels.

The different lump management tools provide varying degrees of flexibility and feedback. Some, such as [[DeePsea]] and [[XWE]], include both level editing and lump management features. Most (but not all) of the tools provide the ability to explore the contents by seeing the lump names in the PWAD directory and similarly many provide visual and audible feedback by letting you view pictures, listen to sound lumps or play music content. Many (such as [[DeePsea]], [[NWT]] and [[XWE]]) allow you to move, copy, and rename lumps in a wad file, while others (such as [[TWT]]) are simple command-line WAD compilers that will create a WAD file from several input files. The GUI interface programs [[DeePsea]], [[WinTex]] and [[XWE]] also allow you to create a WAD file from a variety of input files.
