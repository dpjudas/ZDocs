== Description ==

Seemingly a sequel to {{idgames|id=15094|Remain 1|linkonly=1}}, Remain III is intended to be a retrospective of Doom with the use of GZDoom. The author disables jumping and crouching as well as not including any scripts in an effort to retain the classic Doom feel.

However, the WAD also features 3D floors and dynamic lighting, combined with zombies wearing extra accessories (Chaingunners have black bandannas, for instance) and various monsters from the Bestiary, such as Enhanced Cacodemons and Blood Demons. This 13 map wad provides many challenges and interesting locales for the player to contend with. However, despite the architecture and combat being mostply praised, there were many complaints to the effect that some maps suffered from switches being too well hidden.</text>
