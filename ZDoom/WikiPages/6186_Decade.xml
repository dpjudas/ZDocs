'''Decade''' is a large "techbase" level based on re-interpretations of parts of maps from both [[Doom]] and [[Doom II]]. It is a very large level, making full use of ZDoom features such as [[slopes]] and [[ACS|scripting]], but remaining true nonetheless to Doom's core gameplay.

The level features many secret areas and non-stop action as the enemies are constantly reinforced through monster closets and teleportation traps.
