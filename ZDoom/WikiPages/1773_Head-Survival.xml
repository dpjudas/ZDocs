== Premise ==

This is a multiplayer co-op wad by Zippy.  Players work together to fight back a horde of heads (specifically, the author's head).  Gameplay is round based with health being restored in between rounds and ammo being given back based on an awards system.  There are four classes to play as, but each player must use a different class.  It's balanced for 3 or 4 players, but if you really want to go it alone, there's nothing stopping you.

There are a total of 20 rounds, with boss rounds on round 5, 10, 15, and 20.  There are also 2 extra modes of play (Boss Rounds Only and Survival Mode.)

The premise of the wad is a little silly.  It's mostly a fun little thing for me and my friends, but as long as I made it I might as well put it online, right?</text>
