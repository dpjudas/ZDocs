During the first tic of free fall, that value is added twice.

However, ZDoom offers multiple ways in which the gravity value is affected, instead of being a constant as in [[vanilla Doom]]. An actor's gravity factor is the product of the following factors:
#The [[level]]'s overall gravity, as defined in [[MAPINFO]] with the {{c|gravity}} map property. Note that this value is set on a scale of 800.
#The [[sector]]'s own gravity, as defined in [[UDMF]] with the {{c|gravity}} sector property and in [[Hexen format]] with the [[Static_Init]] special; possibly modified with [[Sector_SetGravity]].
#The [[actor]]'s own {{Property|Gravity}} property in [[DECORATE]], possibly modified through [[ACS]] with the [[ACS actor properties|APROP_Gravity]] property.
Internally, the default values are all 1.0, so a fall lasting one second (35 tics) gives an accumulated speed of 36 in the default conditions.

In addition, being [[underwater]] also affects gravity depending on the depth of immersion: a {{c|waterlevel}} of 1 divides it by 16; a waterlevel of 2 or 3 divides it by 8.

Although you are advised to use MAPINFO for it, level gravity can also be affected with [[FraggleScript]] with either {{c|gravity &lt;int value&gt;}} on a scale of 100 or with {{c|consolecmd gravity &lt;float value&gt;}} on a scale of 1.
