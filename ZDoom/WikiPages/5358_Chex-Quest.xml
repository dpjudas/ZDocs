''Chex Quest'' is a promotional game based on ''The Ultimate Doom'' that was included in cereal boxes. While the game was modified to be cartoony and non-violent, technically it is still very close to Doom, making it more a TC than a different game. The sequel Chex Quest 3 was developed specifically for the ZDoom engine.
