This allows to avoid conflicts if several lumps have the same name, but one is, for example, a texture while the other is a sound.

Lumps belong to a namespace or another depending on where they are in the archive. The [[archive format]] matters: in sequential archives (such as WAD files), they are delimited by marker lumps; in hierarchized archives, they are in a specific directory.

ZDoom uses the following lump namespaces:

{| {{Prettytable}}
! Namespace !! Markers !! Directory !! Notes
|-
| Global || Outside of markers || / (Root directory) ||
|-
| [[Sprite]]s || S_ or SS_ || /Sprites/ || Lumps are added to the Sprite image type.
|-
| [[Flat]]s	 || F_ or FF_ || /Flats/ || Lumps are added to the Flat image type.
|-
| Colormaps || C_ || /Colormaps/ || Optional
|-
| [[ACS]] [[Libraries]] || A_ || /ACS/ ||
|-
| [[Texture]]s || TX_, HI_ || /Textures/, /Hires/ || Lumps are added to the Override image type.
|-
| [[Blood]] RAW || N/A || N/A || Files with the .RAW extension in a RFF archive.
|-
| [[Blood]] SFX || N/A || N/A || Files with the .SFX extension in a RFF archive.
|-
| [[Blood]] misc || N/A || N/A || Apparently unused
|-
| [[Strife]] voices || V_ || /Voices/ || Lumps are automatically assigned svox/&lt;lumpname&gt; as a [[SNDINFO]] logical name allowing them to be referenced directly in [[DIALOGUE]] scripts.
|-
| Hi-Res || HI_ || /HiRes/ ||
|-
| Sounds || No specific markers || /Sounds/ ||
|-
| [[Patch]]es || No specific markers || /Patches/ || Lumps are added to the Wall Patch image type. While not used by the engine, P_ or PP_ markers are often used anyway.
|-
| Graphics || No specific markers || /Graphics/ || Lumps are added to the Misc Patch image type. The Doom alpha and beta used the L_ marker here.
|-
| Music || No specific markers || /Music/ ||
|-
| [[Skin]] || N/A || N/A || All lumps in an archive containing a [[S_SKIN]] lump are placed in a namespace specific to that skin.
|-
| [[Voxel]]s || VX_ || /Voxels/ ||
|}

There is also a sort of equivalent of namespaces for images. The texture manager uses the following types:
{| {{Prettytable}}
! Name !! Description !! Namespace !! [[TEXTURES]] keyword
|-
| Any || Graphics that do not fit into any other category. || N/A || N/A
|-
| Wall || These have priority over flats when applied on a sidedef. || N/A || WallTexture
|-
| Flat || These have priority over walls when applied on a floor or ceiling. || Flats || Flat
|-
| Sprite || Needs to be of the form NAME''fa'' or NAME''fafa'', see [[sprite]] for more information. || Sprites || Sprite
|-
| Wall Patch || The building bricks of composite textures created through [[TEXTUREx]] or [[TEXTURES]]. || Patches || N/A
|-
| Build || See [[Build tiles]] for more information. || N/A || N/A
|-
| Skin Sprite || These have priority over sprites for players using the corresponding skin. || Skin || N/A
|-
| Decal || They are defined in [[DECALDEF]] || N/A || N/A
|-
| Misc Patch || Miscellaneous graphics || Graphics || Graphic
|-
| Font Character || See [[font format]]s for more information. || N/A || N/A
|-
| Override || Has priority on both flats and walls. || Textures || Texture
|-
| Autopage || [[Automap]] background. || N/A || N/A
|-
| Null || An "empty" texture that is never displayed (e.g., TNT1A0). || N/A || N/A
|-
| FirstDefined || The first texture defined in a [[TEXTUREx]] lump (e.g., {{dw|AASTINKY}}). || N/A || N/A
|}
