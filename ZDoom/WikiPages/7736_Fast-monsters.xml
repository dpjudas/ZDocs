    <text bytes="1026" sha1="q0bqw2ujxfg7polyxmuoaqa4zadwa2z" xml:space="preserve">{{doomwiki}}'''Fast monsters''' can be obtained in several ways:
* With a [[MAPINFO/Skill definition|skill setting]] containing {{c|FastMonsters}}
* With {{CVAR|C|sv_fastmonsters}} console variable, which can be set with the {{param|-fast}} parameter or the [[DMFlags|DM flag]] 32768
* By using +{{Flag|ALWAYSFAST}} in a monster definition

Fast monsters can be prevented by using the +{{Flag|NEVERFAST}} in a monster definition.

In fast monsters mode, the following effects apply:
* Actors with [[actor states#State keywords|fast states]] halve the tic duration of these states
* Actors use their {{Property|FastSpeed}}, if defined, instead of their normal {{Property|Speed}}
* If {{c|[[MAPINFO/GameInfo definition|nightmarefast]]}} is set in GameInfo, states calling [[A_Chase]] (or a variant) and having a duration greater than three tics have their duration halved to a minimum of three. This effect can be obtained independently of fast monsters mode by using the relevant flag in the A_Chase call.
