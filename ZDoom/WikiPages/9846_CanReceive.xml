{{c|virtual bool '''CanReceive'''(Inventory ''item'')}}

==Usage==
An {{class|Actor}} function that determines if a specific ''item'' can be received by that actor. Normally, this is called automatically by {{class|Inventory}} items from their '''[[CallTryPickup]]''' call, as soon as they're about to be received (whether by being picked up, or by being given directly).

In the base {{class|Actor}} class this function simply always returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. Can be overridden to add custom behavior.

If there's a need to add behavior ''after'' an item has been received, see '''[[HasReceived]]'''.

If there's a need to modify the pickup rules from the ''item'' rather than its recipient, see '''[[CanPickup]]'''.

===Parameters===
*{{c|Inventory '''item'''}}
:A pointer to the item that is about to be received by the calling actor.

===Return values===
*bool â€” returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if the ''item'' can be received. Returning &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; will prevent the calling actor from being able to receive this item. (If the item was a pickup, it'll stay in the world; if it was being given directly through scripts/cheats, it'll disappear).

==Examples==
This custom {{class|PlayerPawn}} will not be able to receive any items based on the {{class|DoomWeapon}} class:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="csharp"&gt;
class CustomMagePlayer : PlayerPawn
{
  override bool CanReceive(Inventory item)
  {
    if (item &amp;&amp; item is 'DoomWeapon')
    {
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
  // States and Default blocks omitted to keep this example short
}&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
