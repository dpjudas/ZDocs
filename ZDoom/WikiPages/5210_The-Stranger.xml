== Description ==

Inspired by anime such as ''Trigun'', ''Hellsing'' and ''Ghost in the Shell'', this wad packs some serious heat, with two weapons for every slot (making twenty different weapons), ranging from your Martial Arts skill to "A Terrible Secret" and a wide variety of conventional and not so conventional weapons in between. This also includes a less colour saturated palette, monsters replacing some of the stock monsters and a lot of new sound effects. Changes the way ''Doom'' plays considerably with the inclusion of reloading.
