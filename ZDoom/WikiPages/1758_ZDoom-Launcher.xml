This is a ZDoom frontend that I threw together fairly quickly. It has all the command line options listed and help for each one that displays when you click on it.

It also features configuration saving. This will allow you to have several different wads, command-line sets, and even zdoom versions. You can launch those saved configs with a double-click in the list.

Although I designed this with ZDoom in mind, I don't think there would be too much trouble if you were to use it for a different source port.
