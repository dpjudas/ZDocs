'''A_FAxeAttack'''&lt;br&gt;
(''no parameter'')&lt;br&gt;

Works similarly to [[A_FPunchAttack]] except the additional power comes from the presence of ammo instead of the special1 counter. The special1 counter is still set to 0 when there is no hit however.

In addition, the range for this attack is 2.25 times the normal melee range giving 144 units.  Damage will range from 40-62 points of damage which is doubled if ammo is present.  With ammo {{Class|AxePuffGlow}} is used, otherwise {{Class|AxePuff}} is used.  When powered, the victim is pushed back with a strength of six otherwise there is no thrust.

If the player runs out of ammo through this call, the function will jump to the Fire+5 state.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|FWeapAxe}} and derived classes.</text>
