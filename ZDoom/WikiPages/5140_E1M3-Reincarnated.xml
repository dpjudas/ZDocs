== Description ==

Built from scratch, but based heavily on E1M3 from (Ultimate) Doom, Spork's reinterpretation makes use of his clean mapping style, combined with Zdoom features such as scripting, coloured lights and translucent flats to create a very fresh look on E1M3. Whilst it basically retains the same layouts, some creative license was exercised, allowing for the appearance of some non-E1 enemies and a few new traps (one particularly memorable one being the new Blue Key room). Fans of Spork mapping will appreciate this map particularly, but most will enjoy the feeling of familiarity mixed with the new and unexpected.

He later did an [[E1M5 Reincarnated]] too, but he didn't continue on to do the entire episode.</text>
