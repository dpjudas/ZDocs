The '''chasecam''' is a special mode in which the [[camera]] is placed behind the player pawn.

[[ZDoom]]'s chasecam is considered a [[cheat]] and is only available when {{CVAR|C|sv_cheats}} is true or in single-player when cheats are not disabled by a skill. This is because it can be used to view around corners without being seen, as well as to see enemies that are close to the player but outside the field of vision.

The chase cam is controlled by two console variables: {{CVAR|R|chase_dist}} and {{CVAR|R|chase_height}}. It is toggled on and off by the {{CCMD|D|chase}} command.

The {{CVAR|D|chasedemo}} console variable can be used to watch [[demo]]s in chasecam mode.
