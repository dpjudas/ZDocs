The basic idea of reverb is to have echoes and re-pitched sounds in rooms to make them sound like what they actually are, like a cliff edge or warehouse.

==Switching underwater reverb on==
If {{CVAR|S|snd_waterreverb}} is true, [[ZDoom]] automatically applies an underwater reverb to [[deep water]] areas created with [[Transfer_Heights]], [[3D floors]], or a {{Class|WaterZone}} thing. You can change this option from the [[sound options]] menu. Underwater reverb is automatic, and does not require any special behavior in the maps for its use.  You can also force the underwater reverb effect on in any area of your map by using a {{Class|SoundEnvironment}} thing with its first two arguments set to 255 (see below).

Note that this menu option is only for enabling automatic underwater effects in [[swimmable water]]. Any reverb environments that have been placed in the map will always be heard, regardless of this option.

==Using reverb in your maps==
To use reverb in your maps, you need to place the {{Class|SoundEnvironment}} thing (ednum 9048) into your map, and then change its arguments. The first two values are used.

Because only one reverb can be used at a time, you may want to block off a reverb thing from taking over the whole map. To do this, border the area with lines set to be zone boundaries. In a [[UDMF]] map, set ''zoneboundary'' to be true. In the Hexen [[map format]], use [[Line_SetIdentification]], with argument 2 set to 1.

If you set the reverb thing to inactive in your map editor, the reverb effect will not take effect immediately.  You can then activate it via ACS to "turn on" the reverb effect.  However, you cannot simply deactivate the thing to disable the reverb effect; instead, you must activate another one in the same area.  If you want the reverb to turn off completely, you can add a reverb thing with its properties set to 0 0 (See below) and activate it when you'd like to disable all reverb effects.

An example map is found here: http://zdoom.org/files/examples/eax.zip

==Defining a reverb environment==
An environment definition takes a fancy name within strings and two numbers as identifiers, the number combination must be unique. The rest is a list of named parameters within curly braces. On Windows, ZDoom includes an interactive reverb editor accessible with the [[reverbedit]] console command that lets you adjust these settings and get feedback in realtime.
