Material shaders can be applied to a specific graphic (which can be used as a sprite, texture, and so on) and affect it all the time while it's being drawn. Post-processing shaders affect the whole viewport and can be manually enabled and disabled with [[ZScript]]. Shaders can be used to dynamically alter the graphic or the whole image. A common example of a material shader is the [[ANIMDEFS#Warping graphics|ANIMDEFS warp shaders]] that are often applied to liquid textures. Post-processing shaders are used for effects like blur, vignette, hue and color alternation, and such.

== Usage ==
Author can place their custom shaders under the {{c|/shaders/}} directory in their project's [[PK3]] file. To function in the game, shaders must be added via [[GLDEFS]]:
*Material shaders can be applied to images either via the {{c|HardwareShader}} or the {{c|Material}} blocks in GLDEFS. The latter method is more robust and convenient, so it's recommended. It's described [[GLDEFS#Material_shaders|here]].
*Post-processing (screenspace) shaders can be applied via the {{c|HardwareShader}} block, as described [[GLDEFS#Post-processing_shaders|here]].

== See also ==
*[[Structs:PPShader|PPshader struct]] (used to control postprocessing shaders in [[ZScript]]).
