== About ==
''Hacx'' is a standalone game for ZDoom and the [[Eternity Engine]]. Originally released as a commercial [[Doom II]] mod, it suffered from a rushed completion and the competition of games with newer technology, such as the [[Build]] and {{wp|Quake_(video_game)|Quake}} engines. It was later re-released as freeware. More than ten years later, Hacx was resurrected by Xaser and Blzut3, who released a stand-alone update, targeted specifically at ZDoom and Eternity but still compatible with other ports. The new Hacx team is now working on a more complete overhaul, Hacx 2.
