{{Special|213|tag, r, g, b|Sector|Fade}}

* ''tag'': Tag of affected sector 
* ''r'': Amount of red to fade to 
* ''g'': Amount of green to fade to 
* ''b'': Amount of blue to fade to 

Sets the color that light in the tagged sectors fade to as they get further away from the viewer. This will give the sector a “[[fog]]” effect and can greatly enhance the mood of a level. By default, this is whatever the level's {{MapProperty|Fade|fade}} is specified as being in a [[MAPINFO]] lump, or black, if it does not specify a fade. The note about changing a sector's color during the middle of gameplay also applies here. You can use the {{c|{{CCMD|D|testfade}}}} [[CCMDs|console command]] to test a fade from within the game. Keep in mind that '''Sector_SetFade''' is affected by a sector's light, so a faded sector with a light value of 255 will have virtually no visible fade color, and a faded sector with a light value of 0 will be nearly a solid color.

== UDMF ==

If you are using [[UDMF]] for your map, and do not intend to change the fade color later on, you can set a sector's fade without the need of this special. You can find it under a sector's ''custom'' tab, and the values it requires are in hex, i.e. '''RRGGBB'''.</text>
