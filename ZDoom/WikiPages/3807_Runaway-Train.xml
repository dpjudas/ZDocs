== Description ==
Runaway Train is a WAD created by Enjay set on a moving train. It was exported from the author's personal works. The WAD used some very early ZDoom features (mostly [[BOOM]] ones) and [[ACS]] to create the illusion that the player was actually on a moving train. The player was to get to the other side of the train killing any monsters in the way to get the blue key, and make it all the way to the front of the train to stop it before it crashes. The level ended if you were successful.

The WAD somehow is notorious for showing off ZDoom's features to many newcomers, and as a result has introduced many players to the ZDoom community. Despite the title being "Runaway Train" people refer to it as NJTRAIN.
