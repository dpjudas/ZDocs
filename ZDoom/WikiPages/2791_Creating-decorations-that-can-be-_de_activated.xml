It relies on the functionality of [[DECORATE]] which is currently [[Deprecation|deprecated]]. For an up-to-date method in [[ZScript]], see the [[Used|'''Used()''']] virtual function page, it has examples of the same feature.}}

You can also define objects that change their state when being activated or deactivated.

For this purpose, two base classes exist: {{Class|SwitchableDecoration}} and {{Class|SwitchingDecoration}}.

Switchable decoration can be activated and deactivated; whereas switching decorations can only be activated but not deactivated again.

These classes use two special state labels: '''Active''' and '''Inactive'''. You must of course include a spawn state in addition to these two special states to have the actor work properly when spawned.

Activation and deactivation can be controlled by the action specials [[Thing_Activate]] (130) and [[Thing_Deactivate]] (131). In addition, the {{Property|Activation}} property and the {{Flag|BUMPSPECIAL}} and {{Flag|USESPECIAL}} flags can be used to make it possible to control how the actor is activated even without [[ACS]].

An example: this torch starts unlit (TRCHA0), but if the player presses "use" in front of it, it is lighted (TRCHB0). With a switchable decoration and the THINGSPEC_Switch activation flag as well, then it would be possible to make a torch that can be lit and unlit several times.

   }
 }
