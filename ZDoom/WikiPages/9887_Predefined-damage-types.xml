Note, the constants are only readable in [[ACS]] and are not exposed to [[ZScript]], but they are associated with specific [[ZScript]]-readable damage types.

[[ACS]] functions and action specials may require either a damage type name or the MOD constant/value. Creating [[custom damage types]] is possible.
