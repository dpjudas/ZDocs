Etymologically, a {{wp|hub}} is the central part of a wheel, which connects all the spokes. The metaphor is often used for anything that connects together a large number of identical things. In [[ZDoom]], a hub is technically an entire cluster of levels. The term is also sometimes used in a way closer to the original image, by qualifying one level in particular to be the hub for a cluster, for example the {{dw|Hub_1:_Seven_Portals_(map)|Seven Portals}} map of [[Hexen]] is the map from which all other maps in the cluster can be reached.

To define a hub, at least two maps need to be in a single cluster, which needs to have the &lt;tt&gt;hub&lt;/tt&gt; keyword in its [[cluster definition]]. Many features work differently depending on whether the current level is part of a hub or part of a "normal" cluster of sequential levels.
* ZDoom saves the status of each visited level in the cluster. In a non-hub cluster, revisiting a level resets it.
* There is no intermission screen with kill/item/secret tallies between hub levels.
* The inventory remains unchanged when traveling between hub levels; except for {{Class|Powerup}} items without the {{Flag|INVENTORY.HUBPOWER}} flag.
* By default, the [[automap]] does not show the map label when in hub maps.
