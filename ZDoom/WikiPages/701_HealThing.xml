==Usage==
Gives health to the actor that activated the special.

===Parameters===
* ''amount'': the amount by which to heal.
* ''max'': the maximum value the actor's health can reach when healed.

If ''max'' is 0 or the actor to heal is a non-player, {{c|[[GiveBody]]}} is called to handle the healing, with the specified amount passed to it while leaving {{c|GiveBody}}'s ''max'' parameter's value as the default.

If ''max'' is greater than 0 and the actor to heal is a player, ''amount'' is added to the actor's health with no modifications to it; if ''max'' is 1, the actor is healed up to the maximum set by the {{Class|soulsphere}}, which is 200 (this maximum value could be changed via [[DeHackEd]]). Otherwise, if it is greater than 1, the actor is healed up to that value.


{{Warning|do not use negative amounts if ''max'' is greater than 0. While negative amounts are acceptable for use with the call to {{c|GiveBody}}, if ''max'' is greater than 0, {{c|HealThing}} uses those negative amounts as they are, thus reducing the actor's health. {{c|HealThing}} does not kill the actor if it reduces its health to 0 or less, and instead, leaves it in a broken state.}}

==Examples==
This new {{Class|berserk}} powerup uses {{c|HealThing}} to heal the player to full health.

 class NewBerserk : {{Class|Berserk}}
 {
     States
     {
     Pickup:
         TNT1 A 0 [[A_GiveInventory]]("{{Class|PowerStrength}}");
         TNT1 A 0 [[HealThing]](100);
         TNT1 A 0 [[A_SelectWeapon]]("KoolFist");
         Stop;
     } 
 }
