__NOTOC__

'''{{class|Actor}}'''

{{c|void '''ExplodeMissile'''(line ''lin'' }}={{c| null, Actor ''target'' }}={{c| null, bool ''onsky'' }}={{c| false)}}

== Usage ==
Makes the actor explode like a [[projectile]] does when it hits something, including setting its appropriate state, setting its pointers based on its flags, spraying decals, etc. Most often used with actors that have the {{flag|MISSILE}} flag set.

This should be used instead of [[SetStateLabel|{{c|SetStateLabel("Death")}}]] for manually causing a projectile to go to its Death state sequence, since  just changing the state manually will not handle all the other required behavior.

=== Parameters ===
*{{c|Line '''lin'''}}
:The {{struct|Line|line}} that was hit causing the explosion. Default is {{c|null}}. 
*{{c|Actor '''target'''}}
:The {{class|Actor|actor}} that was hit causing the explosion. Default is {{c|null}}. 
*{{c|bool '''onsky'''}}
:If {{c|true}}, consider the actor to have hit the sky. Default is {{c|false}}.

== Examples ==
This version of the {{class|Rocket}} will explode if it was still flying 2 seconds after its existence:

 {{color|green|class}} {{color|blue|TimedRocket}} : {{class|Rocket}}
 {
 	{{color|green|override void}} '''[[Tick]]'''()
 	{
 		{{color|green|Super}}.'''[[Tick]]'''();
  		{{comment|TICRATE is equal to 1 second (currently 35 tics)}}
 		{{color|green|if}} ('''[[InStateSequence]]'''(curstate, spawnstate) &amp;&amp; '''[[GetAge]]'''() &gt;= {{const|TICRATE}} * 2)
 		{
 			{{color|blue|ExplodeMissile}}();
 		}
 	}
 }
