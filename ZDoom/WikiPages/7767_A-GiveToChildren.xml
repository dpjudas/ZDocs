int '''A_GiveToChildren''' (string ''type'' [, int ''count''])

==Usage==
Adds ''count'' items of type ''type'' to the calling actor's ''children's'' inventory. This function will not add more items than can be carried.

An actor's ''children'' are actors which are spawned by said actor through {{c|[[A_SpawnItemEx]]}} with the SXF_SETMASTER flag passed to the function, or by pointer manipulation with functions like {{c|[[A_RearrangePointers]]}} or {{c|[[A_TransferPointer]]}}.

If ''type'' is an item derived from {{c|{{Class|Health}}}}, then the amount received is the result of multiplying ''count'' by the item's {{Property|Inventory.Amount|amount}}, e.g. if ''type'' is {{c|{{Class|Medikit}}}} and ''count'' is 2, then the amount of health received would be 50 points, not 2.

===Parameters===
*''type'': the item to give. This should be a valid {{Class|Inventory|inventory item}}.
*''count'': the number of samples of this item to give. Default is 0, which is interpreted as 1.

=== Return value ===
The function returns the total number of actors which successfully received the item.
