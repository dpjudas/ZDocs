Players are handled differently from other actors because they are user-controlled and the [[player class]] is chosen during the [[class selection menu]] rather than by [[thing]] placement in the [[map]]. [[Demo]]s only record player actions, not [[monster]] actions, as they are the only non-deterministic part of a game.
