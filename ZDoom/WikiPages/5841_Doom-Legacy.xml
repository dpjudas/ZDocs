'''Doom Legacy''' is a port that introduced several features to Doom, notably [[Sector_Set3dFloor|3D floors]], [[Transfer_Heights|deep water]] and [[S_SKIN|player skins]]. It also made use of [[FraggleScript]] and enhanced it. [[ZDoom]] supports some features from Legacy, with [[GZDoom]] offering nearly full-compatibility with it.

Doom Legacy was seemingly abandoned for several years after the 2004 release of 1.42. A port called ReMooD, started in 2008, aims to be its successor. Doom Legacy itself was resurrected in 2010.
