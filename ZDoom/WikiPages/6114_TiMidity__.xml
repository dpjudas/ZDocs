'''{{wp|TiMidity++}}''' is a [[software synthesizer]] capable of using a wide variety of [[sound fonts|sound fonts]]. It is one of the options offered by [[ZDoom]] for [[MIDI]] playback.

==Setting up TiMidity++==
TiMidity++ uses the {{c|{{CVAR|S|timidity_config}}}} console variable to point out to any of the following:
* An SF2 [[sound font]] file
* A ZIP file containing a configuration file called {{c|timidity.cfg}} and a collection of GUS patches
* A TiMidity or GUS configuration file
The default value of "gzdoom" makes it use GZDoom's default soundfont, so changing this is only necessary if you want to use a different sound font or patch set.

===In ZDoom===
{{note|Starting from [[GZDoom version history#3.3.0|GZDoom 3.3.0]], TiMidity++ is now an internal MIDI player. This information below is now outdated.}}
TiMidity++ is an external program, so setting it up is a bit more complicated than for the other MIDI devices.
* First, you will need to download {{plainlink|[http://www.zdoom.org/files/timidity4zdoom2.zip TiMidity for ZDoom]}} and extract it in an appropriate directory, for example a timidity/ subdirectory in your ZDoom installation.
* Then, edit the timidity.cfg file which is in the directory where you installed TiMidity for ZDoom. You need to tell it where to find your sound font. Two options are possible:
:* An actual soundfont: use two lines, first {{c|dir &lt;path-to-soundfont&gt;}}, then {{c|soundfont &lt;soundfont-file&gt;}}
:* A collection of patches: use two lines, first {{c|dir &lt;path-to-patches&gt;}}, then {{c|source &lt;patch-config-file-name.cfg&gt;}}
* Finally, ZDoom needs to be told where TiMidity can be found. Use the {{c|{{CVAR|O|timidity_exe}}}} console variable to point to the TiMidity for ZDoom binary.
Once that is done, set TiMidity++ as the MIDI device in the [[sound options]] menu.

==Advantages and drawbacks==
* TiMidity++ can load more types of sound font formats than the other synthesizers offered by ZDoom
* Although it ignores certain features of the SF2 format and load them as if they were a collection of GUS patches, it is more resistant to errors than [[FluidSynth]]
* It uses relatively little CPU power
