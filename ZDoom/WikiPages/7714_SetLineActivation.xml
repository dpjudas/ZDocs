==Usage==
Sets the line activation flags of the line with the specified ID.

===Parameters===
*''lineid'': The ID of the line of which to set the activation flags.
*''activation'': The activation flags to set. Multiple flags can be set by using the bitwise OR operator (|) between the constant names:
**'''SPAC_None''' — No flags.
**'''SPAC_Cross''' — Activated when crossed by player.
**'''SPAC_Use''' — Activated when used by player.
**'''SPAC_MCross''' — Activated when crossed by monster.
**'''SPAC_Impact''' — Activated when hit by projectile.
**'''SPAC_Push''' — Activated when bumped by player.
**'''SPAC_PCross''' — Activated crossed by projectile.
**'''SPAC_UseThrough''' — Activated when used by player (with pass through).
**'''SPAC_AnyCross''' — Activated by anything crossing it which does not have the {{Flag|TELEPORT}}.
**'''SPAC_MUse''' — Activated by monsters using it.
**'''SPAC_MPush''' — Activated by monsters bumping into it.
**'''SPAC_UseBack''' — The line can be used from the back side.
*''repeat'': Whether the line's assigned action special can be activated multiple times or not.
:{| {{prettytable}}
!Value!!Result
|-
|Greater than 0||Can be activated multiple times
|-
|Equal to 0||Can only be activated once
|-
|Less than 0||No change
|}
:Default is -1.

== Examples ==
The following line sets the tagged line so it can be activated by bumping into it:
 [[SetLineActivation]](1, {{const|SPAC_Push}});

Note that the above line also clears all other activation flags, if any, before setting the new flag. If adding a flag without clearing the ones which are already set is what is desired, then using {{c|[[GetLineActivation]]}} is needed:
 [[SetLineActivation]](1, GetLineActivation(1) | {{const|SPAC_Push}});


This line clears all activation flags of the tagged line, if any:
 [[SetLineActivation]](1, {{const|SPAC_None}});
