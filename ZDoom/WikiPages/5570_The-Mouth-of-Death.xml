== Description ==

[[Image:ph_MoDScreen.png|right|thumb|230px|Not the most detailed or advanced mapset in the world, but still a bit of fun!]]

A bit of teamwork between brothers has produced this simple three-map set, which is pretty much a Doom2.exe wad, but uses MAPINFO and was only ever tested on ZDoom, so is best used there. Paul has only had limited mapping experience before now, so a lot of the mapwork is a mixture of his and Phobus' work. However, MAP03 is divided into 2 sections, one by Paul, and the other by Phobus. Overall gameplay and architecture is largely reminiscent of [[Scourge]]'s earlier levels.

Features:

* 3 maps
* MAPINFO
* New music
* "Old school" gameplay and appearance

Suitable for single play. All levels completable from a pistol start.

Made with:

Doom Builder 1.67 and XWE
