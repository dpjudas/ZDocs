'''A_StalkerLookInit'''

(no parameters)

If the calling actor has the NOGRAVITY flag, it is put in its LookCeiling state; otherwise is is put in the LookFloor state. In either case, the jump only happens immediately if the state it is to go to is different from the state that follows the one with the call to this codepointer.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|Stalker}} and derived classes.
