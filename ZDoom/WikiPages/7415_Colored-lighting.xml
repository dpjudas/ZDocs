'''Colored lighting''' is an effect in which the colors of [[thing]]s and [[level]] geometry within affected [[sector]]s will be modified. For best results in ZDoom's software renderer, light colors should be selected from color ranges well represented in the [[palette]], though [[OpenGL]]-targetting projects are not limited.

Contrarily to [[Boom]] colormaps, colored lighting only affects the content of the sector, even when the [[player]] or [[camera]] is outside.

Colored lights in a sector can be set in several ways:
* In [[UDMF]] only: with the {{c|lightcolor}} sector property.
* With a {{Class|ColorSetter}} thing placed in the sector.
* With the [[Sector_SetColor]] special, which can be used dynamically in a script.

With good use of colored lighting, it is possible to emulate the aspect of {{dw|Sony_PlayStation|PSX Doom}} and, to a lesser extent, {{dw|Doom 64}}.

You can use the {{CCMD|D|testcolor}} console command to test a color from within the game.
