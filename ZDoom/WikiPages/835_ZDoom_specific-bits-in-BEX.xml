    <text bytes="8513" sha1="0yxh6947hjhphvnc10krk2cz02k1fio" xml:space="preserve">In [[DeHackEd]], you can apply a set of bits to define the properties of a given Thing. Originally this was done with a number. You would check some boxes in DeHackEd and get a number such as 65535 to define several properties. In ZDoom, you can use the numeric bit syntax, but on top of it you can define additional properties. So, if you have an object that already has a bunch of properties you want to keep, but you want to add one more without going through the hassle of recalculating the bits -- or even worse, the property you want to apply to the Thing isn't available in DeHackEd (is ZDoom specific) -- then you can just add "+ MF_SPAWNCEILING" or whatever the bit you want happens to be right after the number. It would look like this: "Bits = 65535 + MF_SPAWNCEILING"

The following is straight out of the source (thanks to Enjay who fetched it for me), but it is out of date. I won't bother formatting this right now because I'm sure somebody will complete the list for me and format it much prettier.

It is safe practice when setting any of these bits to explicitly also set all others you want to be set as well, as sometimes ZDoom will reset certain bits. Usually Randy will fix such a problem if you report it on the forums. Also, last I heard you can't use the MF3 or MF4 bits in DEH/BEX yet.
