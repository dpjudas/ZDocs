'''A_FaceConsolePlayer''' [(float MaxTurnAngle)]

Makes the calling actor turn towards the local player - even if the player is for instance coop spying on another player. The MaxTurnAngle is the max turn angle in degrees the actor can make.

Because this is client-specific behavior (the actor will turn to a different direction on every client machine), this will cause a desync of the actor's angle. Thus, it is not recommended to be used on non-decorative actors.

This codepointer encapsulates Hissy's behavior, which was moved to a code-pointer because Hissy was moved out to skulltag_actors.pk3.

== Examples ==
Hissy uses this codepointer to turn towards the local player:
&lt;pre&gt;
Spawn:
    HISY B 1 [[A_FaceConsolePlayer]](5)
    wait
    HISY A 1 [[A_FaceConsolePlayer]](5)
    wait
&lt;/pre&gt;</text>
