== Description ==

Titan 2, released in early 2009, is the sequel to [[Titan]]. It's made for single or cooperative play in Doom 2 and consists of 9 regular hell-themed levels as well as a secret level. [[GZDoom]] features such as dynamic lights and [[3D floor]]s are used, as are regular [[ZDoom]] features such as slopes and scripting. In contrast to [[Titan]]'s mostly linear level design, Titan 2 is predominantly non-linear, leaving the player to decide in which order he wants to progress through the various areas of each level. Titan 2 is also vastly more detailed as well as being significantly more challenging than its predecessor, generally due to having a higher monster count. As was the case in the original [[Titan]], plenty of tricks and traps are employed to keep the player on his toes. The [[WAD]] includes a new weapon in form of the [[Skulltag]] minigun as well as several new monsters, some of which also appeared in the original [[Titan]]. Highlights include various tricks and traps, good visuals and some very hectic and challenging battles, especially on the higher difficulty settings.
