{{Special|14|tag, speed, delay, lock|Door|Animated}}

* ''tag'': Tag of affected sector 
* ''speed'': Duration of each frame in the door animation, in [[Definitions#Units_of_time|tics]]
* ''delay'': Tics until door closes 
* ''lock'': Required key (See [[Key types]])

Opens the affected sector like a door, but instead of raising the ceiling visibly, it instantly raises the ceiling and then plays a texture animation on the front sides of the door sector.  This is used by ZDoom to manage [[Strife]]'s [[Animated door|animated doors]].

There are a few limitations to observe:
# The sector must be set up like a normal door, that is, its ceiling height should be equal to its floor height.
# The texture to be used must be defined in the [[ANIMDEFS]] lump.
# The door sector may only have 2 sides which face another sector.
# Those 2 sides must have the same texture.

==Examples==
Here is an example of ANIMDEFS definition for a Strife door:
 animateddoor  SIGLDR01
 	opensound DoorOpenLargeMetal
 	closesound DoorCloseLargeMetal
 	pic SIGLDR01 
 	pic SIGLDR02 
 	pic SIGLDR03 
 	pic SIGLDR04 
 	pic SIGLDR05  
 	pic SIGLDR06 
 	pic SIGLDR07 
 	pic SIGLDR08 

== Conversions from linedef types ==
The following Doom map format types can be converted as Door_Animated:
{| {{prettytable}}
!Type!!Conversion!!Trigger
|-
|{{icon|Strife}} 144:DR Door Animated || Door_Animated  (0, 4, 105) || Player Use, Monsters Activate, Repeatable
|-
|{{icon|Strife}} 207:SR Door Animated || Door_Animated  (tag, 4, 105) || Player Use, Repeatable
