== General ==
Army of Doom is a project currently in production by Metaldemon. The exact release date is yet to be announced but will be mid-2010. More information coming soon.

== Story ==
The game is set on Mars in the year 2145, 30 years after the events of original DooM series. Mars is now sparsely populated with most of its inhabitants living in small scattered villages. 
Mars City is the hub of the entire planet. You play as a marine hailing from New York who has the task of investigating one of Mars' laboratories near Mars City, built inside a giant crater, codenamed 'Crater Lab'. 
The 'Crater Lab' is a high security facility in which only marines and other authorised individuals are allowed entry.
A distress signal from Mars reached Earth very recently and you have been sent there to investigate. Something has gone terribly wrong at the facility and there is very little information concerning the matter available. 
On the way to Mars a small asteroid hit and crippled your ship as you almost entered the planet and the pilot lost control of the ship, causing the ship to crash land. Luckily you survive the crash, but sadly the ship's pilot and your fellow marines were not so fortunate.
