(no parameters)

==Usage==
Decreases the calling actor's [[health]] by 1 with a probability of 20%. If the health goes below 0 the actor dies. Main usage is in '''Wound''' [[Actor states|state]].

== Examples ==
This is a rotting zombie, a {{Class|ZombieMan|zombie}} that is slowly decomposing and will eventually die. Its See, Missile, and even its Pain states all trigger [[A_GetHurt]], lowering its health, and eventually killing it if the player doesn't first. Its pain sound was removed so that it wouldn't make a noise every time [[A_GetHurt]] was triggered successfully.
