'''A_IceGuyDie'''

(no parameters)


Bursts the calling actor into chunks ({{Class|IceChunk}} and for players also {{Class|IceChunkHead}}) after a short random delay. The actor only bursts if it does not move. [[A_IceGuyDie]] immediately bursts the calling actor without any delay. The size box of the spawned shards will conform to the defined {{Property|Radius|radius}} and {{Property|Height|height}} of the object.

If the calling actor has the {{Flag|BOSSDEATH}} flag, it also calls [[A_BossDeath]].

== Examples ==
This is an ice zombie, a frozen-solid {{Class|ZombieMan|zombie}} that continues to live. When killed, its death state triggers [[A_FreezeDeathChunks]], bursting it into chunks of ice. A 100 frame delay was given to assure the zombie was not moving when this function was called
(in case the corpse ends up sliding down a flight of stairs, off a ledge, etc.).
[[A_NoBlocking]] was removed to prevent the monster from dropping 2 {{Class|clip}}s, since [[A_FreezeDeathChunks]] makes the monster drop its [[item]] upon death as well. Its XDeath state triggers [[A_IceGuyDie]], causing it to instantly burst into chunks.
