: Determines whether (and how) the item is set to be automatically used when the player's health drops below a certain point.
: The following values are accepted:
:: 0 - Item will never be auto-used.
:: 1 - Item will be automatically used when the player would die from damage taken, but only if the currently-selected skill level has the "autousehealth" flag set. (Like the [[Classes:ArtiHealth|Quartz Flask]] from Heretic/Hexen)
:: 2 - Item will be automatically used when the player would die from damage taken, but only if the currently-selected skill level has the "autousehealth" flag set ''or'' during a deathmatch game. (Like the [[Classes:ArtiSuperHealth|Mystic Urn]] from Heretic/Hexen)
:: 3 - Item is auto-used when the player drops below 50% health; if the player has more than 1 such item, they will continue to be consumed until the player is over 50% health. However, if damage takes the player below 0% health, this will not save them from death. (Like Strife's small health items).&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
