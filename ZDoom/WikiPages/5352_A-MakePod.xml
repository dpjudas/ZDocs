'''A_MakePod''' [(string ''podtype'')]

Spawns an actor of type ''podtype'' (by default, {{Class|Pod}}) if there is enough room for it. There are, however, two important differences with other spawn functions such as [[A_SpawnItemEx]] or [[A_SpawnProjectile]]:
*The children actors generated through A_MakePod will appear in their "Grow:" state. They '''''must''''' have a "Grow:" state in order for this codepointer to work correctly.
*A master generating other actors with A_MakePod will keep track of its children and will not spawn more than sixteen of them. If the children call [[A_RemovePod]], however, they are unlinked from their master and leave room for more children. Typically, this is used in the children's death state so that they can be replaced.

A_MakePod is restricted to actors inheriting from {{Class|PodGenerator}} because this codepointer uses the calling actor's &lt;tt&gt;special1&lt;/tt&gt; field to keep track of the amount of children, and other restricted codepointers might use the same field for different purposes.
