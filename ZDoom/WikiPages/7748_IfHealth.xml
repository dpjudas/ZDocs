Executes the following sub block if the player's health is greater than or equal to {{c|value}}. If {{c|not}} is provided, the check is inverted, and the sub block is executed if the player's health is less than {{c|value}}. Passing {{c|%}}, makes the check percentage-based instead of being hit points-based.

== Examples ==
This block of code is executed if the player's health is greater than or equal to 100 points.
 IfHealth 100
 {
   // commands...
 }


This one, however, is executed if the player's health is less than 75%.
 IfHealth not 75 %
 {
   // commands...
 }</text>
