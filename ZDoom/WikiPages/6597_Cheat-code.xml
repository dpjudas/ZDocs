'''Cheat codes''' in Doom engine games are entered by typing them during the game. The cheat system assumes that the keyboard is QWERTY, which can change them on international keyboards. For example, the "iddqd" cheat code would have to be typed as "iddad" on an AZERTY keyboard.

Each game has its own set of cheat codes, though the {{CVAR|C|allcheats}} console variable allows to use them all in any game. For most purposes, the [[console]] offers more power and more versatility than cheats. Although [[DeHackEd]] allows to change the cheat codes, this feature is not supported in [[ZDoom]].

The following cheat codes are supported in ZDoom:
==[[Doom]]==
{| {{prettytable}}
|-
|'''idbehold'''||Displays the message "inVuln, Str, Inviso, Rad, Allmap, or Lite-amp", typing one additional letter gives a powerup:
* "v": {{Class|InvulnerabilitySphere|Invulnerability sphere}}
* "s": {{Class|Berserk}}
* "i": {{Class|BlurSphere|Blur sphere}}
* "r": {{Class|RadSuit|Radiation-shielding suit}}
* "a": {{Class|Allmap|Computer area map}}
* "l": {{Class|Infrared|Light-amplification visor}}
|-
|'''idchoppers'''||Gives and select the [[chainsaw]].
|-
|'''idclip'''||No clipping. Equivalent to typing "noclip" in the console. Contrarily to [[vanilla Doom]], this cheat works in [[Doom]]/[[The Ultimate Doom]] even without allcheats on.
|-
|'''idclev'''''xy''||Warps to level E''x''M''y'' or MAP''xy''. Equivalent to typing "idclev ''xy''" in the console.
|-
|'''iddqd'''||Sets health to 100% (even if higher!) and makes player immune to damage. Equivalent to typing "iddqd" in the console.
|-
|'''iddt'''||This cheat needs to be typed in [[automap]] mode and cycles the value of the &lt;tt&gt;am_cheat&lt;/tt&gt; console variable between 0 and 2.
* First use: full automap (including hidden linedefs normally not shown).
* Second use: full automap with all actors shown as vectorial triangles. ZDoom allows you to give different colors to the various thing types.
* Third use: the automap is restored to normal.
|-

|-
|'''idkfa'''||Equivalent to typing "give backpack; give weapons; give ammo; give keys; give armor" in the console.
|-
|'''idmus'''''xy''||Plays the music from level E''x''M''y'' or MAP''xy''. Contrarily to vanilla Doom, the weapon slots are not triggered when typing this cheat.
|-
|'''idmypos'''||Shows the player's X, Y and Z coordinates. Contrarily to vanilla Doom, the coordinates are given in decimal numbers.
|-
|'''idspispopd'''||No clipping. Equivalent to typing "noclip" in the console. Contrarily to [[vanilla Doom]], this cheat works in [[Doom II]]/[[Final Doom]] even without allcheats on.
|}

==[[Heretic]]==
{| {{prettytable}}
|-
|'''cockadoodledoo'''||Turns the player into a {{Class|ChickenPlayer|chicken}}. Equivalent to typing "morphme" in the console.
|-
|'''engage'''''xy''||Warps to level E''x''M''y'' (or MAP''xy''). Same as the Doom cheat "idclev". Equivalent to typing "idclev ''xy''" in the console.
|-
|'''gimme'''''x''||The code is followed by a letter (a-j or z) which defines which item is given:
* "a": {{Class|ArtiInvulnerability|Valador's Ring of Invunerability}}
* "b": {{Class|ArtiInvisibility|Shadowsphere}}

* "j": {{Class|ArtiTeleport|Darchala's Chaos Device}}
* "z": Equivalent to typing "give artifacts 16" in the console.
|-
|'''iddqd'''||Kills the player. Equivalent to typing "kill" in the console. If "allcheats" is on, the Doom cheat takes precedence.
|-
|'''idkfa'''||Takes all weapons except the {{Flag|WEAPON.WIMPY_WEAPON|wimpy weapons}} that use no ammunitions. If "allcheats" is on, the Doom cheat takes precedence.
|-
|'''kitty'''||No clipping. Equivalent to typing "noclip" in the console.
|-
|'''massacre'''||Kills all monsters on the current level, equivalent to typing "kill monsters" in the console.
|-
|'''noise'''||Toggles sound debug information. The display is different from vanilla Heretic.
|-
|'''ponce'''||Sets health to 100%, equivalent of typing "give health" in the console.
|-
|'''quicken'''||Makes the player immune to damage ("God mode"). Contrarily to the Doom cheat "iddqd", this does not change health.
|-
|'''rambo'''||Equivalent to typing "give backpack; give weapons; give ammo; give armor" in the console.
|-
|'''ravmap'''||This cheat needs to be typed in [[automap]] mode and cycles the value of the &lt;tt&gt;am_cheat&lt;/tt&gt; console variable between 0 and 2. Same as the Doom cheat "iddt".
|-
|'''shazam'''||Gives the {{Class|PowerWeaponLevel2|Tome of Power effect}}.
|-
|'''skel'''||Equivalent to typing "give keys" in the console.
|-
|'''ticker'''||Toggles ticks-per-frame counter, represented by tiny black pixels in the lower-left corner. (They are quite hard to notice on high resolutions.)
|}
'''Note:''' The "ravpic" cheat from vanilla Heretic is not supported, since ZDoom offers a [[screenshot]] command which can be bound to its own key and does not need to hijack the [[info menu]] key instead.

==[[Hexen]]==
{| {{prettytable}}
|-
|'''butcher'''||Kills all monsters on the current level, equivalent to typing "kill monsters" in the console. Same as the Heretic cheat "massacre".
|-
|'''casper'''||No clipping. Equivalent to typing "noclip" in the console.
|-
|'''clubmed'''||Sets health to 100%, equivalent of typing "give health" in the console.

|'''mapsco'''||This cheat needs to be typed in [[automap]] mode and cycles the value of the &lt;tt&gt;am_cheat&lt;/tt&gt; console variable between 0 and 2. Same as the "iddt" and "ravmap" cheats.

|-
|'''sherlock'''||Equivalent to typing "give puzzlepieces 25" in the console.
|-
|'''visit'''''xy''||Warps to level ''xy'', using the value given to the level by the "warptrans" property in its [[map definition]]. Equivalent to typing "hxvisit ''xy''" in the console. This is not the same as the "idclev" or "engage" cheats: for example, "idclev 24" in Hexen will send you to {{dw|Hub_4:_Effluvium|Effluvium}}, whereas "hxvisit 24" will send you to {{dw|Hub_4:_Dungeons|Dungeons}}.
|-
|'''where'''||Shows the player's X, Y and Z coordinates. Contrarily to vanilla Hexen, the coordinates are given in decimal numbers.
|}
'''Note:''' Vanilla Hexen uses different cheats in the demo version, where the codes are derived from the names of the developers (e.g., bgokey for Ben Gokey corresponds to god mode). These cheat codes are not implemented in ZDoom.

Furthermore, the "init", "puke" and "shadowcaster" cheats have been disabled. "Puke" can be used as a [[console command]] instead; but "init" and "shadowcaster" were removed because of technical concerns. Other Hexen cheats not implemented include "~''xy''" to change the CD track number, "mrjones" to display version information, and "martekmartekmartek" to kill the player. Finally, "noise" and "ticker" are implemented as Heretic cheats and can be used in Hexen with "allcheats" on.

|-
|'''elvis'''||No clipping. Equivalent to typing "noclip" in the console.

|'''gps'''||Shows the player's X, Y and Z coordinates.
|-
|'''jimmy'''||Equivalent to typing "give keys" in the console.
