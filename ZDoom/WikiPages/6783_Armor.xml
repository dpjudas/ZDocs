The '''armor''' is a form of protection that decreases damage received by [[player]]s from attacks. The following points are relevant:
* All armor items are [[inventory]] [[actor]]s derived from a subclass of {{Class|Armor}}.
* [[Monster]]s can actually have armor too, if they are given some by a [[script]].
* There exist two types of armor: {{Class|BasicArmor}} and {{Class|HexenArmor}}.
* For basic armors, there are two distinct values: the protection offered ({{Property|Armor.SavePercent}}) and the armor status ({{Property|Inventory.Amount}}).
* Basic armors can also offer special {{Property|DamageFactor}} as a secondary form of protection, and their efficiency can be adjusted with the {{Property|Armor.MaxAbsorb}} and {{Property|Armor.MaxFullAbsorb}} properties.
* For [[Hexen]] armors, there is only a single value, the armor class, wich is used for both.
* Hexen armors are decomposed into four item slots and one basic slot, and the protection each slot provides is a function not of the armor items, but of the [[player class]], through the {{Property|Player.HexenArmor}} property. The armor rating is the sum of the points in all these slots.
* The default Hexen [[HUD]] displays an armor class that corresponds to the armor rating divided by five to show a total on a {{wp|vigesimal}} base rather than a percentile value. Therefore, a displayed armor class of 10 corresponds to about 50% damage absorption and 50 remaining points of armor.

The standard armors include:
* {{Class|AmuletOfWarding}} (Hexen)
* {{Class|BlueArmor}} (Doom, 50% absorption, 200 points)
* {{Class|EnchantedShield}} (Heretic, 75% absorption, 200 points)
* {{Class|FalconShield}} (Hexen)
* {{Class|GreenArmor}} (Doom, 33.333% absorption, 100 points)
* {{Class|LeatherArmor}} (Strife, 33.333% absorption, 100 points)
* {{Class|MeshArmor}} (Hexen)
* {{Class|MetalArmor}} (Strife, 50% absorption, 200 points)
* {{Class|PlatinumHelm}} (Hexen)
* {{Class|SilverShield}} (Heretic, 50% absorption, 100 points)
The armor total can also be increased with the following items:
* {{Class|ArmorBonus}} (1 point up to 200)
* {{Class|ArtiBoostArmor}} (20 points of armor rating/4 points of armor class, or 50 points up to 300)
