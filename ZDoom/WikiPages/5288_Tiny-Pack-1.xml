== Description ==

[[Image:TinyPack1Screen.png|right|thumb|230px|An arena in which you must fight for your life]]
Developed under the false name of "Wonoview" as an experiment to see if Phobus has a distinct mapping style (the conclusion was that he doesn't), this 5 map wad was created in 25 man-hours and challenges the player to fight for his life, then escape with it through small environments following a hellish theme.

This is the first in a possible line of Tiny Packs and maps by Phobus, as they are quite easy and fun to create and fit into a busy schedule easily.

Features:

* 6 maps (5 main levels, and an ending map)
* Survival Horror-esque gameplay
* New TITLEPIC and INTERPIC
* An in game story developed through progression
* Plenty of use of ZDoom features
* 2 difficulty modes

Single play only.

Made with:

Doombuilder, XWE, MSPaint
