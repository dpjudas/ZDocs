[[ZDoom]] needs an IWAD file in order to play; without one the ZDoom engine has no game data to use.

==Supported IWADs==
'''Notes:''' 
* Some file names are links to a page on the {{dwicon|nolink=|Entryway|Doom Wiki}} where you will find checksums for known versions of the concerned file.
* Some files have conflicting names; ZDoom provides you with possible aliases. Note that an IWAD is actually identified by its content rather than its name. Also, any [[archive format]] supported by ZDoom can technically be an IWAD.

ZDoom will detect any of those present in its search path and let you choose at startup which game to play (if it doesn't, [[Frequently Asked Questions#Q. I accidently checked the box which prevents Zdoom from letting me pick my IWAD.21 How do I get it back.3F|see the FAQ]]). In addition to them, some "total conversion"-type mods, such as [[Wolfenstein 3D TC]], can be played as their own IWAD; however since they are not detected as such by ZDoom, you need to use the -iwad [[command line parameter]].

In order to play a custom level designed for any of the above games you have to have that particular game's full IWAD (loading PWAD with shareware, demo or teaser versions is disabled). If you do not have the necessary IWAD, or if you have an old, [[IWAD Patching|unpatched]] version of the IWAD in question, you will get an error message on startup. (But often old versions are accepted too.)

The IWAD file(s) should be placed in a directory where ZDoom will find them. This includes the same directory as the ZDoom executable, as well as those pointed to by the {{c|DOOMWADDIR}} environment variable. You may also configure other directories for ZDoom to search in the [[zdoom.ini]] file. On Linux, the directories {{c|$HOME/.zdoom}} and {{c|/usr/local/share}} are checked by default. Finally, if you have bought a supported game from GOG.com or Steam, ZDoom is able to find the IWADs directly in their installation folder and you do not need to move or copy them to ZDoom's folder.

==Obtaining IWADs==
As noted aboved, some IWADs can be downloaded freely; however most "full" games are not and must be bought from one of the following sources:
;[http://www.gog.com/games#/#sort=bestselling&amp;devpub=id_software&amp;page=1 GOG.com]
:This store offers downloadable versions of ''Ultimate Doom'', ''Doom II: Hell on Earth'' (bundled with ''Final Doom'' and the ''Master Levels for Doom II''), ''Heretic'', ''Hexen'', ''Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel'', and ''Strife''. The Final Doom version offered is the later Anthology version, which fixes many mapping errors (such as the infamous [[doomwiki:MAP31: Pharaoh (TNT: Evilution)#Bugs|missing key in TNT MAP31]]).
;[http://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=Name&amp;sort_order=ASC&amp;publisher=id+Software&amp;category2=2&amp;price=0%2C10&amp;genre=Action Steam]
:This store offers downloadable versions of ''Ultimate Doom'', ''Doom II: Hell on Earth'', ''Final Doom'', ''Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders'', ''Hexen: Beyond Heretic'', ''Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel'', and ''Strife''; as well as the ''Master Levels for Doom II'' which is a set of PWAD, not an IWAD.
:Warning: following the release of ''{{dw|Doom 3: BFG Edition}}'', the ''Master Levels'' are no longer available to purchase individually but can be bought as part of the Doom Classic Complete Pack.
:'''Note:''' The version of ''Hexen: Death Kings'' available on Steam is not patched. You need to download and apply the [http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=7022 Death Kings 1.1 patch] first. (The "readme.txt" file it tries to patch has been renamed readme-dk.txt by Steam, but is not important.) All other IWADs from Steam are fully patched.
;[http://www.amazon.com/ Amazon.com], [http://www.ebay.com/ eBay.com], etc.
:Second-hand copies of the original games can be found on such sites.
;Flea markets, used-games bins in brick-and-mortar stores, etc.
:It's mostly a matter of luck, but they can still sometimes be found this way.

==Custom IWADs==
Since [[GZDoom version history#3.2.0|version 3.2]], [[GZDoom]] allows to define [[custom IWAD]]s that can be detected without having to update the engine's own internal list. These custom IWADs need to have the {{c|.iwad}} or  alternatively {{c|.ipk3}} (not the traditional {{c|.wad}} and {{c|.pk3}}) extension, and they need to include an [[IWADINFO]] lump.
