Drawing heavy influence from [[007: Licence to Spell DooM]], the wad has a mission based setup with heavy scripting and use of ZDoom features.  There are quite a few new monsters (including a family of cyberdemons - see the title), plus a storyline that is partially voice-acted.  Some of the maps have already been released as singles (heh) and a 4-map demo was recently released as well.

To download the 4-map demo, click [http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=12457 here].
To visit the DTCA site, click [http://dtca.2webh.com/ here].

UPDATE: The project site is no longer available, so I'm considering the project abandoned as well.
