'''A_KoraxBonePop'''

(no parameters)

Shoots six {{Class|KoraxSpirit}} actors with 60Â° angle intervals, initializes them by giving them the calling actor as their &lt;tt&gt;tracer&lt;/tt&gt; field, a random number between 32 and 40 as their &lt;tt&gt;special2&lt;/tt&gt; field, and sets its &lt;tt&gt;args[0]&lt;/tt&gt; field to 10. For each spirit, it also creates a tail made of a {{Class|HolyTail}} that has the spirit as its &lt;tt&gt;target&lt;/tt&gt; and the first of three {{Class|HolyTailTrail}} as its &lt;tt&gt;tracer&lt;/tt&gt;, and each tail trail having the next in the list as its tracer. A total of 30 actors are therefore spawned: six spirits, six tails, and eighteen trails.

It then starts script number 255 with the calling actor as the activator. In the original [[Hexen]] map when {{Class|Korax}} is fought, this script opens up the door leading to the endgame.

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|Korax}} and derived classes.
