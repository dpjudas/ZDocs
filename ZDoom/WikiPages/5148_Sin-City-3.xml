== Description ==

Released about 5 years after its prequels, this map lets you relive the final battle of the player from the previous [[Sin City]] wads. This map makes use of new textures, music, sounds and a lot of [[ZDoom]] features, but unlike [[Sin City 2]], the cutscene is shorter and the map a bit longer, bringing the overall gameplay experience back to as it was. Highly atmospheric as far as the story and texturing is concerned, the gun play is still a similar style to the original, but as the level is a bit bigger, the monster count is notably higher.
