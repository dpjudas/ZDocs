}}[[Classes]]: &lt;u&gt;Heresiarch&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Heresiarch is a powerful sorcerer with a wide range of attacks and defenses. It has four different attacks, which are seleted mostly at random when it casts a spell:

* Two [[Classes:SorcFX1|bouncing lava heads]] that follow the player like a seeker missile.
* Total invulnerability and missile reflection, that lasts for a long time and makes the game irritating to play. This defense has a visual indicator, in the form of two [[Classes:SorcFX2|orbs]] that encircle the Heresiarch and leave a [[Classes:SorcFX2T1|trail]] behind him.
* A [[Classes:SorcFX3|summoning projectile]], that spawns a [[Classes:Bishop|dark bishop]] where it lands.
* A wide cone of [[Classes:SorcFX4|purple fireballs]] that spew out rapidly in a whiplash pattern.

It also has [[Classes:SorcBall|three]] [[Classes:SorcBall1|different]] [[Classes:SorcBall2|floating]] [[Classes:SorcBall3|cubes]] over its head, which spin rapidly when it is charging a spell. These cubes break away when it is killed, bouncing around and eventually exploding violently.

Note that you cannot give a [[special]] to this monster: its native action functions make use of its args field, preventing a special from being called with reliable parameters. Instead, when the Heresiarch dies, it will run the [[ACS|script]] with a number equal to its special. For example, in {{dw|Hub 4: Gibbet|Gibbet}}, the Heresiarch has for special 20. However, when it is killed, instead of calling [[Floor_LowerByValue]], it executes this map's script 20 (which raises a ceiling).
