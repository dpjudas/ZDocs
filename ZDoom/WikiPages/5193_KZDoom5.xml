== Description ==
{{:KZDoom}}Bringing you back to the industrial theme, this large level will pit you against more monsters than any of the previous [[KZDoom]] maps and keeps largely to what you'd expect from the series - so be sure to prepare for interesting uses of ZDoom features along with some tough battles and a lot of supplies to help you get through it all. Considered something of a benchmark for maps from 2000, the design is simple, yet very effective and still looks quite good. Resources used are much the same as earlier industrial KZDoom maps, making use of the Doom 2 resources as a base for edited graphics, and Quake 2 sound effects for added ambiance.</text>
