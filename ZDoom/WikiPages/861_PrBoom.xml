'''PrBoom''' is a [[source port]], derived from the [[MBF]] branch of [[Boom]], developed by Florian Schulze, Colin Phipps and Andrey Budko. The latter also maintain a version with many additional features, called '''PrBoom+'''. An [[OpenGL]] renderer is available as a different executable, called '''GLBoom''' (or '''GLBoom+'''). All of them feature full Doom, Boom and MBF demo compatibility.

Development for PrBoom has mostly ceased, however PrBoom+ is still actively developed and enhanced with new features, as long as they do not alter gameplay: PrBoom+/GLBoom+ supports [[ZDBSP|extended nodes]] (but not compressed nodes), [[GLDEFS]] skyboxes, the [[MUSINFO]] lump, etc.
