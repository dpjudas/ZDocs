While the practice of representing a bridge through vertically-offset middle textures surrounding an {{Class|InvisibleBridge}} has long been a staple of [[ZDoom]] modding, the possibility of discarding the bridge thing and relying just on the middle texture being there has been pioneered by the [[Eternity Engine]], which could not use bridge things at all given its lack of support at the time for setting a thing's Z-height (only allowed by the Hexen and textual [[map format]]s). Adopting this feature in ZDoom required overcoming the limitations of the [[linedef]] structure, whose flag field was already fully-used, and this was not a priority given the perfectly serviceable bridge things available.

However, they were eventually added anyway. There are three different ways to set a linedef as being a 3D middle texture, depending on the choice of [[map format]]. From simplest to most complicated:
#[[UDMF]]: All that is needed is checking its "midtex3d" flag (named "Walkable middle texture" in DB2 and GZDB and "3D MidTex" in Slade 3).
#Hexen format: [[Line_SetIdentification]] has to be used, with extraflag 32.
#Doom format: Flag bit 10 (Value 1024 or 0x400) represents the 3DMidtex flag (Same value as in Eternity.)
