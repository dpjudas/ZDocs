== Description ==

Running on E1M1 of Heretic in GZDoom, this map is based largely on [[Enjay Thiefy]], but uses more atmosphere, more features and Heretic enemies, plus a lot of DECORATE. The wad features comments made by the player character, an interesting twist at the end, loot and a lot of dynamic lighting. However, this is also a very dark, moody map which is well crafted and makes use of a lot of extra resources to expand upon the standard Heretic fare.

Popular due to it being one of the few Heretic wads available, and a good one at that, it set something of an early standard for GZDoom mappers.

Some areas of this map may slow your computer a little due to lighting, particle effects and open spaces.</text>
