'''ZDoom''' is a [[source port]], originally based off [[ATB Doom]] and [[NTDoom]]. It has since added practically full support for [[Boom]], [[Chex Quest]], [[Heretic]], [[Hexen]] and [[Strife]]; and several games have been developed specifically for it. It has added many additional features, including slopes, uncapped fps and z-clipping. The [[source code]] was maintained by [[Randy Heit]] and [[User:Graf Zahl|Christoph Oelckers]]. Its development was stopped and it was succeeded by [[GZDoom]]; the last version is 2.8.1.

{{note|While arguably imprecise, the term "ZDoom", unless otherwise specified, is often used to refer to GZDoom as well (including, in some cases, throughout this Wiki), since GZDoom is a continuation of the same engine and has backwards compatibility with ZDoom. This applies, among other things, to ZDoom Forums and ZDoom Community, which are largely focused on GZDoom, since ZDoom itself was discontinued in 2016.}}
