;{{LE|1.11}} (March 6): {{Plainlink|[http://www.zdoom.org/files/old/zdoom111.zip Build] {{!}} [http://www.zdoom.org/files/old/zdoom111s.zip Source]}}
:Initial release, based on the [[NTDoom]] and [[ATB Doom]]. The version numbering follows from the Doom source code version numbering of 1.10.
:* Works under both Windows 95 and NT 4.0, although it works best under Win95.
:* Limited support for the Pause key. It works with some keyboards on some machines.
:* Supports any resolution compatible with your DirectDraw drivers.
:* Look up/down Ã  la ''[[Heretic]]''.
:* Translucency for selected objects.
:* Has a [[console]] with most of the functionality of ''Quake'''s. The only significant missing feature is Tab-completion.
:* Notarget [[cheat]].
:* Command to {{CCMD|D|kill}} all [[monster]]s in a level or yourself.
:* Can play [[MUS]], [[MIDI]], and MOD music.
:* Selected sounds are played in surround sound.
:* Doors that need keys to open are highlighted on the [[automap]].
:* Automap now shows various statistics in addition to the level name.
:* True keybindings. Bind any key to any command or sequence of commands.
:* [[Intermission]] screen can now display your stats using absolute values rather than percentages.
:* A new more general [[demo]] format.
;{{LE|1.12}} (April 7): {{Plainlink|[http://www.zdoom.org/files/old/zdoom112.zip Build] {{!}} [http://www.zdoom.org/files/old/zdoom112s.zip Source]}}
:* Some visual enhancements were made such as centering the menus and drawing borders around the status bar in higher resolutions.
:* [[Console command]]s can now be specified on the [[command line parameters|command line]].
:* Removed some of [[Doom]]'s limits such as VisPlanes, VisSprites, and 2S [[HOM]].
:* Rewrote some of the inner loops in assembly. (There was some assembly in 1.11, but it never got used.)
:* New [[CVAR]]s relating to mouse movement. ({{CVAR|C|invertmouse}}, {{CVAR|C|m_pitch}}, {{CVAR|C|m_yaw}}, etc.)
:* Mouse movement doesn't get sluggish in high resolutions.
:* [[Automap]] colors are customizable.
:* Automap overlay and rotation are available.
:* Eight [[crosshair]]s.
:* Shoot up/down.
:* Alt-Tab and Pause work properly on all machines now.
:* The {{CCMD|P|+jump}} command now works.
:* 25% and 75% translucency levels in addition to 50%. The translucency tables now get saved to disk, too, so they only need to be calculated once instead of every time the game is run.
:* The [[console]] [[font]] is now editable.
:* Near complete support for [[DeHackEd]] patches. (Only monster infighting and changing a few minor text strings are not supported.)
:* Sky height and position is now fixed for high resolutions. (It still wraps if you look up, but at least now if you look straight ahead, it never will.)
:* Weapon sprite is always drawn at the correct location. (It was being drawn too low in some resolutions like 400x300.)
:* New [[options menu]], which includes a key configuration screen.
:* [[Stealth monster]]s.
:* New full-screen [[HUD]].
:* And a few other things not worth mentioning separately.
;{{LE|1.13}} (May 26):{{forum|t=4|Release thread}} | {{Plainlink|[http://www.zdoom.org/files/old/zdoom113.zip Build]}}
:* Fixed some major bugs (that crashed the game) and other lesser bugs that were just annoying.
:* 3-D collisions for walking under and standing on other things.
:* The status bar can be scaled to the full width of the screen.
:* The screen mode can be selected from a menu inside the game.
:* ZDoom can run in a window on the desktop.
:* Better [[DeHackEd]] support. Only a few text replacements are not supported. Everything else works (including monster infighting which I haven't seen in any other port).
:* New features for level designers (see editing.txt for details):
::*Specification of next and secret maps on a per-map basis.
::*Specify sky texture on a per-map basis.
::*Use any lump in a wad as music for a map.
::*Give maps a custom name without using a DeHackEd patch.
::*Maps can be named anything (not just E?M? or MAP??).
::*Place any messages of any length between any two maps.
::*''[[Hexen]]''-style fog (of any color).
::*[[Ambient sound]]s &amp;mdash; either point like ''Quake'' or global like ''[[Heretic]]'' and ''Hexen''.
::*Automatic use of [[DeHackEd]] patches in PWADs.
::*No more {{dw|tutti-frutti}} for short textures of certain heights.
::*zdoom.wcf file for use with [[WadAuthor]].
:* Rocket jumping. (One very important note about this: You need to be *in the air* when your rocket explodes for rocket jumping to work. This is different from ''Quake'', and I will probably rewrite it for the next release.)
:* Dynamic [[palette flash]]es.
:* Supports stretching skies for [[freelook]].
:* Larger freelook range.
:* Added tab-completion to the [[console]].
:* zdoom.cfg is now the name of the default [[configuration file]] since [[Doom Legacy]] decided to start using config.cfg.
:* French language support. (Set {{CVAR|C|language}} CVAR to "french".)
:* Player obituaries.
:* Unlimited ammo cheat (use g_unlimitedammo cvar).
;{{LE|1.14}} (July 22): {{forum|t=5|Release thread}} | {{Plainlink|[http://www.zdoom.org/files/old/zdoom114.zip Build] {{!}} [http://www.zdoom.org/files/old/zdoom114-src.zip Source]}}

:* Single-player demos recorded with ZDoom are generally smaller than before.
:* ''Quake 2''-style deathmatch flags.

:* Mode X is now supported under Win95, so all the machines that couldn't run ZDoom in 320x200 before should be able to now.
:* Fewer conditions result in error messages that quit the game. (If you have ''[[Heretic]]'', try this: Start ZDoom with -file heretic and go to the console and type "{{CCMD|D|map}} E1M1".)

:* [[Alias]]es are now saved in the config file.
:* Added support for multiple pitched sounds like in very old version of Doom. (Use the snd_pitched cvar to turn it on and off.)
;{{LE|1.14a}} (July 27): {{forum|t=6|Release thread}} | {{Plainlink|[http://www.zdoom.org/files/old/zdoom114a.zip Build] {{!}} [http://www.zdoom.org/files/old/zdoomsrc114-114a.zip Source]}}

:Mostly minor bug fixes, released because [[Herian 2]] needed some of those fixes. There are a few new features, however:

;{{LE|1.17b}} (March 17): {{forum|t=21|Release thread}}

;{{LE|1.17b1}} (March 19): {{forum|t=22|Release thread}}

:* Maps with mapthings of type 0 no longer generate warning messages.
:* [[Crusher]]s that do no damage no longer act as if they inflict pain to actors.
:* The [[alias]] command lists aliases again.
:* Aliases are saved to the [[config file]] again.
;{{LE|1.18 test 3}} (July 2): {{forum|t=37|Release thread}}
:* Removed unnecessary display mode switches.
:* Created a DCanvas class to encapsulate most 2D rendering.
;{{LE|1.18 test 4}} (July 3): {{forum|t=39|Release thread}}
:* Fixed the "Bad DCanvas::CopyRect" problem introduced in test3.
:* Fixed [[sound sequence]]s that should not be cut off when stopped (such as the standard doors).
;{{LE|1.18 test 5}} (July 6): {{forum|t=40|Release thread}}
:* Fixed a potential infinite loop that was introduced in [[#1.18 test 1|118test1]].
:* Delayed the initial execution of [[CVAR]] callbacks.
:* Added ''[[Heretic]]'''s {{wp|Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm|anti-aliased Wu line drawer}} to the [[automap]].
;{{LE|1.18 test 6}} (July 10): {{forum|t=41|Release thread}}
:* Rewrote the {{wp|Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm|Wu line drawer}} to look better (especially in overlay mode).
:* [[Sky stretching|Stretched skies]] now get stretched horizontally as well as vertically.
:* Did an initial integration of the [[Cajun Bot]] 0.71 code.
;{{LE|1.18 test 7}} (July 12):
:* Fixed handling of maps with scrolling walls.
:* Single player works again. In test 6, all games were considered either [[coop]] or [[deathmatch]].
:* Disabled the [[bot]] thinking code in single player games, so you don't suffer a performance hit when not using bots.
:* Added some performance counters accessible through the {{CCMD|D|stat}} command.
;{{LE|1.18 test 8}} (July 20): {{forum|t=43|Release thread}}
:* Fixed a crash problem with the "burn" [[screen wipe]].
:* Fixed a crash problem with playing non-assigned [[sound sequence]]s.
:* Fixed a crash problem related to trying to shutdown the music subsystem twice.
:* If you try to add more coop [[bot]]s than there are coop starts, the extra bot leaves quietly instead of ending the game.
:* {{CVAR|C|sv_weapondrop|Weapondrop}} is now a "server" CVAR, which it should have been in the first place.
:* Changed the nodetable file format to be more compact.
:* Bots can now be recorded in demos.
:* Bots work in [[multiplayer]] games. Still buggy. Spawning bots can cause consistency failures, and they can start spinning wildly.
;{{LE|1.18 test 9}} (August 9): {{forum|t=44|Release thread}}
:* Fixed the "wild" [[bot]] spinning problem.
:* Commands like {{CCMD|D|changemap}} that could make network games go out of sync should work properly now. The reason they would do that is closely related to the reason that the bots would start spinning.
:* Finished the serializer. Now savegames work. [[Hub]]s don't, because I haven't written the player travelling code yet.
:* Various other code cleanup.
;{{LE|1.18 test 10}} (August 14):

:* Added [[swimmable water]].
:* Messages printed to the middle of the screen also print to the [[console]].
:* Skill and other server [[CVARs]] get saved in [[savegame]]s again.
:* Added liquid [[texture warping]].
:* Bad [[MAPINFO]] lumps generate error messages instead of hanging.
:* Realized that it's impossible to guarantee that all object pointers will be valid without some effort, so FArchive saves DObject objects as NULL objects now instead of aborting with an error.
:* Added the [[built-in ACS functions]] [[LocalAmbientSound]], [[ActivatorSound]], and [[SetLineMonsterBlocking]].
:* Added a {{Class|SecretTrigger|thing}} that does nothing but count toward the number of [[secret]]s.
:* Added a {{CCMD|D|fly}} mode.
:* Finally implemented the {{CCMD|P|+moveup}} and {{CCMD|P|+movedown}} commands.
;{{LE|1.18a}} (September 12): {{forum|t=47|Release thread}}
:Bugfix release.
:* Fixed [[liquid warping]] temporarily stopping when changing levels.
:* {{CCMD|P|+mlook|+/-mlook}} commands do not generate unknown command messages.

:* {{Class|TeleportDest2|Teleport destination (no gravity)}} now works as intended.
:* Hopefully fixed [[savegame]] problems.
:* [[Bots]] are restored from savegames.

:* In sectors with [[damaging floor]]s and swimmable [[deep water]], the damage will also be applied while the player is swimming and not just when the player is on the ground.

:Bugfix release.
:* Fixed crash when saving games with more than 1024 objects.
:* Fixed crash when loading a game without starting a new one first.
:* Reduced the size and frequency of pregame network packets, under the assumption that problems people were having using 1.18 on the Internet are a result of limited modem bandwidth.
;{{LE|1.19}} (November 24): {{forum|t=53|Release thread}} | {{forum|t=54|Source/Linux build release thread}} | {{plainlink|[http://www.zdoom.org/files/old/zdoom-1.19.tar.gz Source]}}
:First official Linux build.
:* [[DeHackEd]] patches that set an actor's {{Property|DeathSound|death sound}} to 0 without removing the [[A_Scream]] call no longer crash.
:* Fixed sync problems when playing with {{Class|BulletPuff|bullet puffs}} as [[particle]]s vs as sprites.
:* Fixed friction when walking on the bottom of swimmable water.
:* Added Jeffrey Cuenco's fixes to get {{c|{{param|-host}}}} and {{c|{{param|-join}}}} [[command line parameters]] to work properly.
:* Fixed [[Boom]] [[Generic_Door|generalized locked doors]] so that the open/close type will actually close.
:* Added pointer tracking and cleanup. This should fix the occasional crashes when saving games and various other anomalies.
;{{LE|1.20}} (November 25): {{forum|t=56|Release thread}}
:Bugfix release.
:* Fixed saving, reloading, and then resaving [[savegame|games]] when travelling between levels in a [[hub]].

:Bugfix release.
:* Fixed problems with thinkers removing themselves and causing other thinkers to not get a chance to think.
:* Added {{CVAR|R|hud_scale}} CVAR
;{{LE|1.22}} (November 12): {{forum|t=60|Release thread}} | {{plainlink|[http://www.zdoom.org/files/zdoom/1.x/zdoom122.zip Windows build] {{!}} [http://www.zdoom.org/files/zdoom/1.x/zdoom-1.22-i386.tar.gz Linux build] {{!}} [http://www.zdoom.org/files/zdoom/1.x/zdoom122-src.zip Windows source] {{!}} [http://www.zdoom.org/files/zdoom/1.x/zdoom-1.22.tar.gz Linux source]}}

:*Added several things from [[ZDoom Community Build]] (unofficial 2.0.96x) and [[GZDoom]], including custom [[DECORATE]] [[weapon]]s.
;{{LE|2.1.1}}{{rev|226}} (June 25): {{forum|t=10630|Release thread}} | {{versionlinks|2|1|1}}
:Bugfix release.
;{{LE|2.1.2}}{{rev|257}} (July 17): {{forum|t=10895|Release thread}} | {{versionlinks|2|1|2}}
:*Added custom [[player class]]es.
:*Added "replaces" keyword for [[DECORATE]].
:*[[IWAD selection box]] now remembers the last choice.
:*Added [[A_RadiusThrust]] to DECORATE.
:*Added [[ThingCountName]] and  [[SpawnSpotFacing]] to [[ACS]].
:*Changed additive scroller options into a [[compatibility options|compatibility flag]].
;{{LE|2.1.3}}{{rev|265}} (July 18): {{forum|t=10930|Release thread}} | {{versionlinks|2|1|3}}
:Bugfix release.
:* Sounds can be specified by full path now in [[SNDINFO]] and [[S_SKIN]].
:* [[DECORATE]] replacement is more universal.
:* Added NecroMage's submission for bitwise/shift assignment operators for [[ACS]]. (Requires [[ACC]] 1.42+.)
:* Changed PlayAttacking2 to always use the melee state instead of different implementations per player and hard coding it to MissileState+1. Also changed PlayAttacking for the {{Class|HereticPlayer}} to use the same animation as PlayAttacking2. Now the special handling for ''[[Heretic]]'' in the FireWeapon functions can be removed.
;{{LE|2.1.4}}{{rev|273}} (July 29): {{forum|t=11063|Release thread}} | {{versionlinks|2|1|4}}
:*Added partial emulation of [[Boom]]'s TRANMAP by analyzing such lumps and extrapolating translucency level from them. This does not work for non-translucency effects that can be achieved with TRANMAPs.
:*Added a {{CVAR|C|queryiwad_key}} cvar to control which key can force the [[IWAD selection box]] to appear. It can be either "shift" or "control". Any other value will disable its functionality.
;{{LE|2.1.5}}{{rev|321}} (September 2): {{forum|t=11466|Release thread}} | {{versionlinks|2|1|5}}
:*New [[ACS]] functions: [[GetPlayerInfo]], [[ChangeLevel]], [[SectorDamage]], [[ReplaceTextures]]
:*New [[DECORATE]] functions: [[A_PlaySoundEx]], [[A_StopSoundEx]]
:*The {{CVAR|C|vid_nowidescreen}} cvar can be used to disable widescreen aspect ratio correction.
:*[[A_SpawnDebris]] and [[A_SpawnItem]] can optionally transfer the caller's color translation to the newly spawned item.
:*New morphing artifacts can be created by subclassing the {{Class|MorphProjectile}} and {{Class|MorphedMonster}} classes.
:*[[A_FireCustomMissile]] has a new parameter: Previously it always aimed straight ahead and altered the projectile's angle according to the resulting direction. If the 6th parameter is 1 now it will aim at the specified angle directly.
:*Users can now define their own [[TEXTCOLO|text colors]], and there are several new standard ones.
:*The fourth parameter of [[Polyobj_StartLine]] and the fifth parameter of [[Polyobj_ExplicitLine]] now set the line's ID.
:*DECORATE explosion parameters are no longer considered deprecated.
:*Calling [[Radius_Quake]], [[Thing_Activate]], or [[Thing_Remove]] with a [[TID]] of 0 now operates the activator.
:*Strife's {{Class|PhosphorousFire}} now does completely thrustless damage.
:*An actor's damage in DECORATE can now be specified as an expression that is evaluated each time it needs to do damage. To do this, enclose it within parentheses, and the normal Doom damage calculation will be bypassed.
:*Passing a negative script number to the {{CCMD|D|puke}} [[console command]] now runs the script with [[ACS_ExecuteAlways]] instead of [[ACS_Execute]].
:*[[Polyobject]]s defined with [[Polyobj_ExplicitLine]] are no longer limited to 64 segs.
:*Starting a new game or reloading an old one no longer resets the [[chasecam]].
:*The [[automap]] background is now a regular texture.
:*Added support for many [[image format]]s for use as textures: [[PNG]], JPEG, PCX, TGA, DDS.
:*Numerous bugfixes.
;{{LE|2.1.6}}{{rev|346}} (October 2): {{forum|t=11758|Release thread}} | {{versionlinks|2|1|6}}
:*Scaled 2D images are supported.
:*Dehacked max health usage defaults to consistency with other ([[Boom]]) ports.
:*A ''font'' parameter was added to [[A_Print]].
:*Quoted strings in [[DECORATE]] can no longer span multiple lines without using the escape character (\) at the end of each line. This makes it easier to spot places where you unintentionally left off a closing quote and got an error several lines later.
:*A new {{CCMD|O|writeini}} console command can be used to save [[the ini]] at any time, with any file name.
:*If the ini is write-protected when you quit, an error dialog now opens to let you know your settings could not be saved and gives you the opportunity to unprotect it.
:*Multiple stat displays can be enabled at once.
:*Several bugfixes.
;{{LE|2.1.7}}{{rev|365}} (October 31): {{forum|t=12015|Release thread}} | {{versionlinks|2|1|7}}
:*Alias commands can now do parameter substitution. If you have %x, where x is some number, in an alias command, it will be replaced by the appropriately numbered parameter passed when the alias is used, with %0 being replaced by the name of the alias itself.
:*A new {{Class|MapMarker}} actor has been added that you can use to mark points of interest on the [[automap]]. If its first argument is zero, the map marker itself appears on the automap, otherwise it is drawn on top of any actor with a [[TID]] matching that argument. If the second argument is one, then the map marker will only be appear if the player has previously seen the sector it is in. You can use [[Thing_Activate]] and [[Thing_Deactivate]] on markers to turn them on and off. To make custom markers, all you need to do is subclass MapMarker with [[DECORATE]].
:*Added the [[SetActorPitch]] [[ACS]] command to set an actor's pitch.
:*You can pass multiple jump targets to the [[A_Jump]] [[DECORATE]] function, and it will choose one of them at random if it jumps.
:*Using a [[TID]] of 0 with [[Thing_Deactivate]], [[SetActorAngle]], [[Thing_Spawn]]*, [[Thing_Projectile]]*, and [[Thing_Move]] will now operate on the activator.
:*The fifth argument for [[Line_SetIdentification]] can be used to set the high byte of the line ID.
:*Added a {{Property|CameraHeight}} [[DECORATE]] property for actors.
:*Added special death states for [[projectile]]s hitting actors. If missiles hit a non-bleeding actor, they try the Crash state first. If that doesn't exist or the actor is bleeding, they try the XDeath state next. If they hit anything else or neither of the two states are defined, they use the normal death state.
:*Added a {{Flag|PIERCEARMOR}} [[DECORATE]] flag for projectiles.
:*The {{CCMD|D|morphme}} [[console command]] can be given an optional argument to specify which class to morph into.
:*Miscellaneous bugfixes.

''No release this year.''
==2008==
;{{LE|2.2.0}}{{rev|748}} (February 15): {{forum|t=16272|Release thread}} | {{versionlinks|2|2|0}}
:*This is the final version of ZDoom to fully support Windows 95 since later versions switched to [[FMOD Ex]].
:*Added [[custom damage types]], with monsters being able to have different custom pain chances, custom damage factors, and custom death sequence for each damage type. Also, damage-specific player pain and death sounds.
:*Custom damage color for [[palette flash]]es per [[player class]].
:*Custom state labels. New states can be defined in [[DECORATE]].
:*The [[SBARINFO]] lump for creating status bar and other [[HUD]]s.
:*[[Skill definition]] in [[MAPINFO]], with many properties.
:*Most thing functions treat a [[TID]] of 0 as the activator now.
:*Support for [[ENDOOM]] screens and the graphical or semi-graphical [[startup lumps|screens]] from ''[[Heretic]]'', ''[[Hexen]]'' and ''[[Strife]]''.

::*{{Class|PowerDrain|Drain}}, {{Class|PowerHighJump|HighJump}} and {{Class|PowerRegeneration|Regeneration}} runes as powerups and used specific player sounds for their sound effects.
::*PowerQuadDamage and PowerQuarterDamage as more customizable {{Class|PowerDamage}} and {{Class|PowerProtection}}. These new powerups allow free customization of the damage modification per damage type by inheriting from these classes and setting specific values. Such derived damage/protection powerups will be considered as separate powers so that for example a QuadDamage and a DoubleDamage item can be stacked which would result in 8x damage.
::*{{Property|Armor.MaxBonus}} and {{Property|Armor.MaxBonusMax}} properties to create armor bonuses that increases the max amount that can be given by other armor items.

:*{{Property|Player.RunHealth}} property to expose the {{Class|StrifePlayer}}'s behavior of not being able to run when its [[health]] is below 10.
:*Customizable gravity per actor
:*New {{CCMD|D|summonfoe}} console command, which is analogous to {{CCMD|D|summonfriend}} but forces the summoned creature to be hostile instead.
:*Added two new [[MAPINFO]] flags to control what actor activates impact lines: {{c|MissileShootersActivateImpactLines}} (the current behavior) and {{c|MissilesActivateImpactLines}} (the original ''[[Hexen]]'' behavior).
:*More player water sounds: {{c|*dive}} (head goes below water), {{c|*surface}} (your head goes back above water), {{c|*gasp}} (getting air back after starting to drown)
:*Using "*" with [[ACS]]'s music commands will play the level's default music set in [[MAPINFO]]

;{{LE|2.8.1}}{{cs|1a9bc53}} (February 23): {{Forum|t=50968|Release thread}} | {{versionlinks|2|8|1}}
* {{c|#region}}/{{c|#endregion}} is now supported for text lumps. ZDoom does not do anything with them but ignore them, but this allows editors to treat them however they like.
* Better [[LANGUAGE|localizability]] of the [[menus]].
* [[TERRAIN|Terrain]] definitions can now be optional.
* Walking into an area with a [[REVERBS|reverb effect]] no longer mutes all sound.
* ''[[Heretic]]'''s {{Class|ArtiTimeBomb|time bomb artifacts}} now spawn in the proper locations.
* ''Heretic'''s powered {{Class|Mace|firemace}} balls once again seek their targets.
* The {{Class|Whirlwind|whirlwind attack}} used by ''Heretic'''s {{Class|Ironlich}} sometimes fizzled out immediately.
* Instant [[sector]] movement actions are again instant.
* Various other minor fixes.

==Post 2.8.1==
The following additions are available in [[Git]] builds, but never were released officially before ZDoom ceased development.

:* The scripting branch was merged, laying the VM groundwork for [[ZScript]].
:* [[DECORATE]]: 
:** [[Actor_states|States]]: 
:*** Can contain multiple action functions enclosed in braces
:*** &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; blocks
:*** return; statement
:** Functions:
:*** Added the following non-action functions: [[CountInv]], [[GetDistance]]
:*** Added the following action functions: [[A_SetChaseThreshold]]
:* Portals via [[Line_SetPortal]] (visual only; {{Forum|t=46916|original forum thread}})

The final commit to ZDoom was made December 29, 2016.  These features would become part of [[GZDoom version history|GZDoom releases]].
