__NOTOC__
== Description == 
[[Image:museum.jpg|right|thumb|230px]]
Enter a realm where anything is possible.  Where things will happen that logically can't, and it will lack what logically should.  Are you ready to enter the museum?

Most of the planned features have not been revealed, however this project would have contained a full story complete with characters, history, and voice acting.  Most importantly, it would have featured surreal environments matched with scripting that were to give the maps that extra "zing".  Original music has been composed solely for this project, along with a unique weapons system never before seen in Doom.
