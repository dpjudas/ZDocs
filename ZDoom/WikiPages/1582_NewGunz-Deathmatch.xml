New Guns DeathMatch is a WAD with the regular doom2 weapons, and more weapons (from ewpns.wad), made for DeathMatch. '''Voting Area''' is the start where players go vote for the level they want to play. Has screenshots of the levels so the player knows what he is voting for.

 DM Mappers requested! Agent ME can be contacted at [mailto:agentme@sbcglobal.net link agentme@sbcglobal.net], thru email, Yahoo, or MSN/Windows Messenger!

New Guns will support add-ons, without having to re-download a new whole wad. Add-ons will include the add-oned level only and the necessary textures, etc.

NEW! Added to wadsinprogress.info. Go to [http://wadsinprogress.info/?a=listwads&amp;wad=454] and see screenshots, and post comments.

''I'm starting to doubt I'm going to get an add-on system''

''Also, you might be able to find me on DooMConnector testing betas of NewGunz DeathMatch. The Wad might be named "guntime***.wad" (*** is version number)''

''This project is currently halted :( But I'm still looking for mappers, and that may re-new my want to work on this''
