    <text bytes="1230" sha1="fktd4v3at06dni3n05gzqcgv2rk8zut" xml:space="preserve">{{doomwiki|Monster_infighting|monster infighting}}'''Infight''' happens when a [[monster]] is damaged by another monster. Monsters are normally immune to [[projectile]]s from monsters of the same [[species]], but they can be damaged by a different species, the blast damage from an exploding attack, and [[hitscan]] attacks. Further refinement to damage-inflicting behavior between monsters can be obtained with [[custom damage types]], and the actor flags {{Flag|DONTHARMSPECIES}}, {{Flag|DONTHARMCLASS}}, {{Flag|NOINFIGHTING}} and {{Flag|NORADIUSDMG}}, and more.

But infighting itself can be modified with the {{CVAR|C|infighting}} [[console variable]]. It is possible to affect it in [[MAPINFO]] [[map definition]]s with the "noinfighting", "normalinfighting" and "totalinfighting" keywords.
*No infighting means that monsters will never infight, although they will still suffer from friendly fire.
*Normal infighting is the standard behavior explained above.
*Total infighting removes the "same species protection" and let monsters be damaged by projectiles from their kin, triggering retaliation.

The {{Flag|DOHARMSPECIES}} flag allows for monsters of the same species to hurt each other at all times.
