As of GZDoom 2.4, most of the internal menu handling has been exported to ZScript, allowing for modders to create flexible and highly customizable menus. However, menus are also (one of) the most complex systems to work with in ZScript. Knowledge on the workings and mechanics of ZScript itself may help.

== General Information ==
Before starting, knowing the [[Object scopes and versions|scope]] system is highly recommended. Every menu and function except for {{c|Menu.SetMenu}} has a '''ui '''scope. This means only approved functions can access actors such as [[CountInv]], which are marked within actors.txt as 'clearscope'. 

== Menus ==
Menus themselves are the very base foundations which hold items (see below), displaying and interacting them all on screen. Several types of menus are available:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! Description
|-
| '''[[Classes:Menu|Menu]]''' || The super class, inherited from by all menus internally.
|-
| '''[[Classes:ListMenu|ListMenu]]''' || Used for Doom's main menu.
|-
| '''[[Classes:OptionMenu|OptionMenu]]''' || Used for most menus under the Options submenu.
|-
| '''[[Classes:GenericMenu|GenericMenu]]''' || A completely blank template for modders who wish to redesign menus in their own way.
|}

'''NOTE:''' For completely custom menus, inheritance must be done with GenericMenu, NOT the base menu!

Each of these can be inherited by a child class to gain functions and properties. '''GenericMenu''' simply inherits and does not change anything from the base '''Menu''' class except for initialization, while ListMenu and OptionMenu come with a plethora of menu items and pre-programmed functionality.

== Menu Items ==
Items are referred to the objects being displayed on screen while inside a menu, regardless of interactive or static. All items inherit from the super class '''MenuItemBase'''.

For a more exhaustive listing of items, see the class pages directly.

{| class="wikitable"
