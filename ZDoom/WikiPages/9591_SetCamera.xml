'''{{class|Actor}}'''

action native void '''SetCamera''' (Actor ''cam'', bool ''revert'' = false)

== Usage ==
Sets the players' camera to the actor specified on the ''cam'' parameter. Does nothing if not called from a player.

=== Parameters ===
*{{c|Actor '''cam'''}}
:An actor pointer to the actor to set the calling players' view to.
*{{c|bool '''revert'''}}
:False by default, when set to true. The player will be able to revert back to their original view by moving. This is the same as in the [[ChangeCamera]] [[ACS]] function.

== Examples ==
This special pistol has an altfire that changes the players' camera to that of their [[Structs:PlayerInfo#Variables|attacker]], if any. But the player can get out of their attackers' view by simply moving.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="csharp"&gt;
class AttackerCamPistol : Pistol
{
	States
	{
	AltFire:
		PISG A 4
		{
			//Sets the camera of the player to their attacker, if any. With the ability to revert back to their view by moving.
			self.SetCamera(self.player.attacker,true);
		}
		Goto Ready;
	}
}&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
