== Description ==
{{:Zort}}Finished on 16th January, 2003, a mere few weeks after the previous Zort, we are treated to the best of the series. With quite high attention to detail, a dark, brooding atmosphere and advanced use of ZDoom features, this map is one of the better ZDoom wads from the earlier years. The chainsaw has been made more powerful to aid in combat (largely due to the very limited ammo).

Quake 1, Quake 2 and Half-Life were again the sources for ambience and new sounds in the map, and the wad this time makes use of HeXen candles and other different resources. Music is by Julian.</text>
