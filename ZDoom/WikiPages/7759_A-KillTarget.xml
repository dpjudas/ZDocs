'''A_KillTarget''' [(string ''damagetype'' [, int ''flags'' [, string ''filter'' [, string ''species'' [, int ''src'' [, int ''inflict'']]]]])]

==Usage==
Kills the calling actor's [[actor pointer|target]]. Optionally, a damage type can be given. Note that damage inflicted by this codepointer is not affected by damage factors.

==Parameters==
*''damagetype'': if the actor dies, the actor will enter a death state based on the specified damage type if present (or pain state if using {{Flag|NODAMAGE}}). Default is "{{c|{{DamageType|None}}}}"
*''flags'': the following flags can be combined using the {{!}} character between name constants:
**'''KILS_FOILINVUL''' - kills monsters and/or missiles that have the {{Flag|INVULNERABLE}} flag.
**'''KILS_KILLMISSILES''' - causes missiles that are affected to enter their death state. Note that this follows the INVULNERABLE and NODAMAGE rules for monsters.
**'''KILS_NOMONSTERS''' - do not target monsters with this function. Alone, it makes the function do nothing, but can be combined with KILS_KILLMISSILES to only affect missiles.
**'''KILS_FOILBUDDHA''' — the ''{{Flag|BUDDHA|buddha}}'' effect is ignored when attempting to kill the actor.
**'''KILS_EXFILTER''' — inverts the case of the class name filter; the calling actor's target is only killed if its class name does not match the value passed to ''filter''.
**'''KILS_EXSPECIES''' — inverts the case of the [[species]] filter; the calling actor's target is only killed if its species does not match the value passed to ''species''.
**'''KILS_EITHER''' — the calling actor's target is killed if either of its class name or [[species]] matches the values passed to ''filter'' and ''species'', respectively.
*''filter'': the actor class to kill. The calling actor's target is only killed if its class name matches the specified filter class. Default is {{c|"None"}}.
*''species'': the actor [[species]] to kill. The calling actor's target is only killed if its species matches the specified species filter. Default is {{c|"None"}}.
* ''src'': Indicates the [[Actor pointer|actor pointer]] responsible for dealing the damage. A monster dealing the damage should use AAPTR_DEFAULT, and missiles should use AAPTR_TARGET (so monsters can identify missiles belonging to their owners and give proper credit for the kill). Default is AAPTR_DEFAULT.
* ''inflict'': The actor doing the actual damage. By changing this, the actor's flags upon the pointed actor are taken into account instead of the calling actor's own.
