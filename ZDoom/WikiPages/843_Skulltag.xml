It was originally created by Brad "Carnevil" Carney, then transferred to a development team as Carney tackled new projects. The current version (0.98d) is based on ZDoom 2.3.1 revision 1551 and GZDoom revision 127/323.

Skulltag went open source on the 13th of February 2012. On the 4th of June 2012, it was discontinued, when the development team forked the project into [[Zandronum]] to acquire autonomy from Carney.
