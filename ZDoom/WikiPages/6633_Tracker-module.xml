Contrarily to MIDI, there is no single standardized format; instead each tracker software having its own format. This also means that playback needs to be done with a compatible [[module replayer]]. The most commonly used formats are known by their file extensions and include MOD, IT, XM, etc.

[[ZDoom]] supports a variety of tracker module formats listed [[music format#Module formats|here]].
