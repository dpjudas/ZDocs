[[File:CustomizeControls.png|thumb|The customize controls menu in [[Strife]].]]The '''customize controls''' menu allows to bind and unbind actions to keys and buttons from the keyboard, mouse or joystick. Its [[MENUDEF]] name is {{c|CustomizeControls}} and it can be summoned with the {{c|{{CCMD|O|menu_keys}}}} console command.

While in the menu, the "Enter" key selects a command for adding a bound key, the "Escape" key cancels the change, and the "Backspace" key unbinds all keys bound to this command. Controls that are bound to an action with a + prefix (e.g. "+attack") are continuous: they start being executed when the corresponding key is pressed, and will continue until the key is released, issuing the reverse command ("-attack" in this example). Any [[console command]] can be bound to a key; custom sections with additional commands can be added to the standard customize controls menu with a [[KEYCONF]] lump. 

The controls are listed in this order:
:*Controls &amp;mdash; generic movement, action and attack keys
:*Chat &amp;mdash; say and team say
:*Weapons &amp;mdash; next and previous
:*Inventory &amp;mdash; next and previous, use, drop
:*Others &amp;mdash; [[automap]], [[chasecam]], coop [[spying]], [[screenshot]], [[console]]
:*Strife popup screens &amp;mdash; the [[Strife]] HUD has three popup screens revealing various info
:*''Custom'' &amp;mdash; mods may feature additional functions through a [[KEYCONF]] lump; if so they will be displayed there.
