'''A_ShedShard'''&lt;br&gt;
(''no parameter'')&lt;br&gt;

Creates new {{Class|FrostMissile}}s if the calling actor's {{c|special2}} counter is greater than zero. The direction in which these new missiles will be spawned depend on {{c|special1}}, used as a flag array:
*1: Left
*2: Right
*4: Up
*8: Down
If {{c|special1}} is 15, four new missiles will be created. In any case, the newly-created missiles will have their {{c|special2}} set to one less than the calling actor's, and their first argument set to 2 or 0 depending on whether the calling actor's {{c|special2}} is 3 or not. The spawned missiles share the calling actor's {{c|target}}. Other aspects depend on the spawned missile's direction:

;Left and right:
:A new missile is created at the calling actor's position, going at a horizontal angle of 5Â° in the appropriate direction. The new missile's {{c|special1}} is set to only left or right, as appropriate. Its vertical velocity is the same as the calling actor's, but its horizontal velocity depends on the calling actor's {{c|special2}}, using this formula:
::''velocity = 20 + 2 * ({{c|special2}} - 1)''

;Up and down:
:A new missile is created eight map units above or below the calling actor. The new missile's {{c|special1}} is set to up or down as appropriate, as well as left and right if the calling actor's {{c|special2}} is an even number. Its vertical velocity is the same as the calling actor's, but its horizontal velocity depends on the calling actor's {{c|special2}}, using this formula:
::''velocity = 15 + 2 * ({{c|special2}} - 1)''

This codepointer is restricted to {{Class|FrostMissile}} and derived classes.</text>
