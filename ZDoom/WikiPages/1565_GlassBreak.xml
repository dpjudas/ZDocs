The '''GlassBreak''' special is used to create glass that breaks when the line is activated. Normally you should set the line's activation type to ''projectile hits'' and the flags to ''impassable''. When this special is activated three things happen:

* The line's [[ANIMDEFS|switch texture]] state is changed (from on to off or vice versa) and the switch sound is played.
* The line's flags are changed to be non-blocking.
* If ''dontspawnjunk'' is 0, seven actors of ''type'' are spawned at the line's center (at the side the line is facing to). ''type'' is the [[spawn number]] associated with the actor class to spawn. If it is 0, the actor class to spawn defaults to {{Class|GlassJunk}}.

== Conversions from linedef types ==
The following Doom map format types can be converted as GlassBreak:
{| {{prettytable}}
!Type!!Conversion!!Trigger
|-
|{{icon|Strife}} 182:G1 Break Glass || GlassBreak() || Impact Hit, Missile Cross, Monsters Activate
