{{c|virtual void '''AttachToOwner'''(Actor ''other'')}}

==Usage==
A [[ZScript virtual functions|virtual function]] called by {{class|Inventory}} items when they've been received ([[TryPickup]] has run successfully) and the item now has to be attached to the recipient's inventory. The item in this case can be either the original item, or a copy created via [[CreateCopy]] (for example, in multiplayer, [[class|Key|keys]] copy themselves rather than being picked up directly, so that the original key can stay behind to be picked up by other players).

Can be overridden to add custom behavior executed by items once they've become a part of an actor's inventory.

'''Important notes:'''
* This function is only executed when an item is received for the first time (ther &lt;code&gt;other&lt;/code&gt; actor doesn't have an instance of this item in ther inventory). When items of the same type are received again, this function isn't called; instead they find this instance in the other's inventory and increase its amount and destroy themselves (this happens in [[TryPickup]]). If you want something to happen whenever an item is received, even if it's a duplicate, override [[Use]] instead.
* This isn't called at all on items that don't actually get placed in the inventory, like {{class|Health}}, {{class|PowerupGiver}}, {{class|BasicArmorPickup}} and others.

=== Parameters ===
*{{c|Actor ''other''}}
:The actor that is receiving the item.

== [[ZScript]] definition ==
{{ZScriptDefinitionNote|actors/inventory/inventory.zs#L730}}
Various items may override this function, but the base {{class|Inventory}} class defines it as follows:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="csharp"&gt;
	virtual void AttachToOwner (Actor other)
	{
		BecomeItem ();
		other.AddInventory (self);
	}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

See [[BecomeItem]] and [[AddInventory]].
