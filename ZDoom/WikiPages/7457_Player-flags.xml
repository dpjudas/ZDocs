:Player is not thrusted by attacks when invulnerable.
* '''{{LE|PLAYERPAWN.CANSUPERMORPH}}'''
:If this flag is given to a player morph, the morphed player recieves a [[Classes:ArtiTomeOfPower|tome of power]] if they are attempted to be morphed again. This is used by the [[Classes:ChickenPlayer|chicken morph]] to reproduce the original behavior of Heretic and its "super chickens".
* '''{{LE|PLAYERPAWN.CROUCHABLEMORPH}}'''
:Enables crouching for morphed player classes.
* '''{{LE|PLAYERPAWN.WEAPONLEVEL2ENDED}}'''
:Signals that an {{Class|PowerWeaponLevel2|enhanced weapon power}} has expired, so the code responsible switches the player's powered-up weapon back to its normal form.
:This flag was introduced as part of a solution to make switching from the powered-up weapon to its normal form seamless upon the power's expiration, so it may not be used in user code.
&lt;!-- There's a PF_VOODOOZOMBIE flag too, but it's private. --&gt;
* '''{{LE|PLAYERPAWN.MAKEFOOTSTEPS}}''' {{git|12d1afc}}
:Enables the pawn to run [[MakeFootsteps]].
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
