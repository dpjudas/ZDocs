* [[THINGS]] - 10 bytes
** Bytes 0-1: Location (x) (short)
** Bytes 2-3: Location (y) (short)
** Bytes 4-5: Facing angle (short)
** Bytes 6-7: Type ID (short)
** Bytes 8-9: Flags (short) 
* [[LINEDEFS]] - 12 bytes
** Bytes 0-1: Start VERTEX (short)
** Bytes 2-3: End VERTEX (short)
** Bytes 4-5: Attributes (short)
** Bytes 6-7: Special effects type (short)
** Bytes 8-9: Tag (short)
** Bytes 10-11: Right SIDEDEF (short)
** Bytes 12-13: Left SIDEDEF (short) 
* [[SIDEDEFS]] - 30 bytes
** Bytes 0-1: Texture x offset (short)
** Bytes 0-3: Texture y offset (short)
** Bytes 4-11: Upper texture name (8 byte string)
** Bytes 12-19: Lower texture name (8 byte string)
** Bytes 20-27: Middle texture name (8 byte string)
** Bytes 28-29: Sector id (short) 
* [[VERTEXES]] - 4 bytes
** Bytes 0-1: x coordinate (short)
** Bytes 2-3: y coordinate (short) 
* [[SEGS]] (created by node builder)
* [[SSECTORS]] (created by node builder)
* [[NODES]] (created by node builder)
* [[SECTORS]] - 26 bytes
** Bytes 0-1: Floor height (short)
** Bytes 2-3: Ceiling height (short)
** Bytes 4-11: Floor texture (8 byte string)
** Bytes 12-19: Ceiling texture (8 byte string)
** Bytes 20-21: Light level (short)
** Bytes 22-23: Special sector (short)
** Bytes 24-25: Tag (short) 
* [[REJECT]] (created by node builder)
* [[BLOCKMAP]] (created by node builder) 

All long integers are 32 bit unsigned longs in little-endian format (shorts are signed, 16 bits, little-endian as well). So the byte sequence 212 2 0 0 is really 0 0 2 212 which translates to 724 decimal.
